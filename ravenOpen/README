Welcome to RavenMUD!

This is our first release, so I don't know what problems you'll 
encounter when you try to run this software.

To use this software, in the ravenOpen directory, type:

  ./configure

Change directory to src:

  cd src

Compile:

  make

If this does not work, you should verify that you're using gcc version 
3.x.  To do this, type gcc --version.  If you're using version 4.x, 
you'll need to edit the makedefs file.  Set CC = gcc to instead be CC = 
gcc3.4 or whatever the name of your gcc3.x program.


Once it's been compiled, you can run the executable moon which is the 
basic game.  You want to do something like the following from the main 
directory:

  ./bin/moon -d sys 6060


Good luck!
