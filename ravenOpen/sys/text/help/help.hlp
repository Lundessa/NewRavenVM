! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

ABBREVIATION ABBREVIATIONS PARSER

   Here at RavenMUD we have installed a sophisticated command parser to help
you enjoy your mudding experience. You only need to type enough of the command
so that the Mud can understand you. For example: 'te ras boo there' would
be the same as 'tell rasmussen boo there'. This should help you deal with
complex mob and player names.

NOTE: if the parser gets confused and you end up with a mob as a target rather
      than the player you intended, remember that 0.(target) means 'a player
      named target'. So you could tell 0.guard to avoid talking to a city
      guard.

ABILITIES

These are the "traits" of a character.
The six abilities are :
			    STRength
			    DEXterity
			    WISdom
			    INTelligence
			    CONSTITUTION
                      CHARisma

Wisdom and constitution are important to have, if possible, when you gain a
level.  Intelligence is important to have, if possible, when you practice
your skills with the practice command.

AC

   "AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -100 to 100, roughly defined
as follows:

                      ===========================
                      |   Armor        Armor    |
                      |   Class        Class    |
                      ===========================
                      | Naked        78 to  100 |
                      | Covered      56 to   77 |
                      | Clothed      34 to   55 |
                      | Protected    12 to   33 |
                      | Armored     -11 to   11 |
                      | Shielded    -12 to  -33 |
                      | Shrouded    -34 to  -55 |
                      | Impervious  -56 to  -77 |
                      | Godlike     -78 to -100 |
                      ===========================
Equipment has different value in regards to AC, as follows:
Position		Multiplier
BODY			3.0
SHIELD, HEAD		2.0
ABOUT			1.5
ARMS,LEGS, CLOAK	1.0
ORBIT, EAR, HOLD, LIGHT 0(i.e. no ac)
ALL OTHERS		0.5

Any left over fractions are kept, and may add to give an extra full point.
Note: These modifiers only apply to ARMOR.

One final thing worth noting is that an ac below -100 will have no further
effect on your chance of being hit, but will reduce the damage taken from
any physical attack.

ADVANCEMENT

   Advancement is a system that allows players to specialize in their class.
After a player reached level 50, they can begin their pursuit of advancement.
There are 10 levels of advancement and each level has a cost of 1 billion
experience points and 100 quest points.  The benefits of advancement are class
specific.  For details, "help <class> advance".

Usage       : cast 'age' <victim>

AGGRESSIVE

Usage       : automatic + see below
Description :

   After many years spent in the wild, a rangers senses become keenly
honed, enabling him/her to respond with incredible speed to dangerous
situations. A ranger with this ability can attack instantly as an enemy
enters the room, before they have any opportunity to react. In order to
"get the jump" on the enemy in this way, the ranger must see them actually
arrive. This skill is thus particularly useful in combination with the
heightened senses skill(see heightened senses for details). There are
4 options the ranger can specify for how they will use this skill. To
see what they are(and what your current setting is), simply type:
> aggressive

And this will display how you can control your "aggressive behavior".
The options are:
1) OFF - you will not be aggressive.
2) MONSTERS - you will attack aggressive monsters
3) PLAYERS - you will attack players you are not grouped with(be careful!)
4) BOTH - you will attack aggressive monsters as well as players, as above.

For example, if you're feeling particularly blood thirsty today:
> aggressive both
Will make you instantly attack aggressive monsters and players who are
unfortunate enough to cross your path.

If you are killed, aggressive is automatically changed to OFF. It's assumed
you don't want to enter the game and take on the world naked.
Be particularly careful when using this skill to attack players, it would be
VERY easy to start a fight you wish you hadn't. :)
Also note that YOU are responsible for how you control your use of this skill.
If you get yourself killed with it, TOUGH. In general though, you're better off
getting the jump on something, even if it is really nasty.

ALIAS ALIASES

   An alias is a single command used to represent one or more other commands.
The ALIAS command can be used to manipulate your character's aliases.  Type
ALIAS alone to see a list of your currently defined aliases.

> alias

Type ALIAS <alias name> <command> to create a new alias.  The alias name must
be one word.  The command can be any string.  Aliases may not be nested or
used recursively.  Any command may be overridden by an alias (other than the
ALIAS command itself, of course).

> alias gbb get bread bag
> alias gac get all corpse

Type ALIAS <alias-name> to delete an alias that has already been defined.

> alias gbb

A semicolon (";") can be used to define multiple actions to be taken with
a single alias.

> alias eat get bread bag; eat bread

Note that the 'eat' contained within the eat alias is interpreted as the MUD's
internal eat command; aliases may not be nested or used recursively.  The
variables $1, $2, ... $9 may be used to represent arguments given with
an alias.  For example:

> alias killem cast 'fireball' $1; cast 'harm' $2
> killem fido mage

Would cast fireball on fido, followed by casting harm on mage.  Variables
may be used repeatedly and in any order:

> alias helpem cast 'heal' $1; cast 'bless' $1; cast 'armor' $1

The special variable $* represents the entire input line after an alias:

> alias tr tell rasmussen $*
> tr hi there, how are you today?
You tell Rasmussen, 'hi there, how are you today?'

NOTE: aliases now save with renting or quitting, after level 15. There is
      a limit on the number of characters that save, so you can have many
      small aliases, or a few very long aliases. When connected you can
      have as many aliases as you like however.

ALIGNMENT

   Alignment is a measure of how good, how neutral, or how evil your
character's actions are.  Killing things that are evil generally makes you
good, and killing things that are good generally makes you evil.

ART-OF-THE-DRAGON ART-OF-DRAGON DRAGON

Usage      : <automatic>
Description:

   Only in whispers will the name of this art form ever be heard of, and even
then only in the deep recesses of a Shou-Lin temple. The few who have been
said to master this art form, were said to have learned it from the study of
the most deadly creature of them all, and after it the art is named. The only
known masters are the Dalai Lama and the dreaded leader of the Order of
Mortis, Chou Lung. What the art actually does is unknown, no one has managed
to get a response from the Dalai Lama, while none have received a response
from Chou Lung and survived...

ART-OF-THE-TIGER ART-OF-TIGER TIGER

Usage      : <automatic>
Description:

   Shou-Lins study the actions of many animals and learn from them. From their
study of the great cats is born this art form of the most fierce of them all,
the tiger. While the lion may be called King of the Jungle, it will be a rare
day that a tiger will lose to a lion. After many hours of practice and
discipline a Shou-Lin may come to master the art of the tiger and so can
strike out in combat, tearing into their opponent with terrifying ferocity.

ASPECT

Usage       : aspect <preference>
Description :

   A Shou-Lin may adopt a variety of aspects during combat. Each aspect must be
assumed and only one may be active at a time.  The Shou-Lin can change his or
her preference at will.

SEE ALSO: SHOU-LIN, ASPECT OF THE WIND/CRANE/SNAKE/FLOWER/MONKEY

ASPECT-OF-THE-CRANE CRANE

Usage      : <automatic when assuming the crane aspect>
Description:

This Shou-Lin skill is automatically used in combat.  When successful, it
produces a nice series of kicks which look real impressive. This skill has
no effect on the Shou-Lins current stun level, but may certainly have an
effect on that of their opponent! This skill will work on "unstunnable" mobs.

SEE ALSO: SHOU-LIN, ASPECT
#0
ASPECT-OF-THE-FLOWER ART-OF-FLOWER FLOWER

Usage      : <automatic when assuming the flower aspect>
Description:

   Deeply committed Shou-Lins spend much of their lives studying the form of a
simple flower. The flower grows from a small seed, into a beautiful plant that
all too quickly withers and dies, to become soil within which another seed may
lie and another flower may grow. Many Shou-Lins may spend years studying the
deep mysteries of the life of a flower, and only a very few may solve the
puzzle and thus come closer to harmony with their soul. Having achieved such
harmony, the Shou-Lin can withstand terrible forces that might otherwise blast
his/her body into oblivion. In game terms, a Shou-Lin who has mastered the art
of the flower is incredibly resistant to the harmful forces of damage
spells and may in turn absorb the mana dealt. If the Shou-Lin makes their saving
throw and the skill succeeds, they take NO damage at all. If the Shou-Lin fails the
saving throw, but the skill succeeds, only half the damage is taken. Only if the
Shou-Lin fails both the saving throw and the art of the flower, will full damage be taken.

#0
ASPECT-OF-THE-MONKEY ASPECT-OF-MONKEY MONKEY

Usage      : <automatic when assuming the monkey aspect>
Description:

   Shou-Lins have learned from the antics of monkeys and have developed this
an art form. A Shou-Lin who has mastered this art is a very difficult opponent
to fight, for he is very unpredictable. In game terms, this means the Shou-Lin
can dodge the skills their opponent attempts to use upon them,
e.g. bash, kick, trip, backstab etc.

A Shou-Lin versed in this art will have a better chance of successfully using
a skill against another master.

ASPECT-OF-THE-SNAKE SNAKE

Usage      : <automatic when assuming the snake aspect>
Description:

   It is said that masters of this art must endure the burning poison of the
cobra on many occasions, until finally, if they survive, they can unravel the
secrets of the snakes poison and with but a simple touch, replicate it in
another. The truth is unknown, but it is true that those Shou-Lins who have
mastered the art of the snake may strike with out with blinding speed, and
with a light touch cause their opponent to suffer just as if the venom of a
snake flowed in their veins...

SEE ALSO: SHOU-LIN, ASPECT
#0
ASPECT-WIND ASPECT-OF-THE-WIND

Usage       : <automatic when assuming the wind aspect>
Description :

   Early in their lives, Shou-Lins study the movement of the wind and watch
closely the effects it has. If the Shou-Lin can explain the mysteries of the
wind, then they are ready for further training and can master this art.  In
game terms, this art allows the Shou-Lin to reflect arrows and objects thrown
at him/her.

ASSASSIN

   Assassins are masters at killing and at avoiding being killed.
Preferring to avoid a toe-to-toe fight whenever possible they are
skilled at backstabbing, poisoning, and anything else that might
give them an advantage! Certainly not as skilled at swords as
Blademasters, they can still hold their own in all but the
toughest fights and even then you had better watch your back,
for Assassins seem to have a knack at finding the 'chinks' in
your armor!

ASSASSINATION

Usage      : automatic once learned.
Description:

   Normally, the most damage that can be inflicted(or received) is
200hps. An Assassin who has learned this skill will be capable of inflicting
any amount of damage upon their opponent with a backstab(including a circle),
the only limit being the Assassins damage roll and backstab multiplier. The
chance of the skill succeeding is related to the relative level of Assassin
and victim, as well as the assassination skill level(which will improve with
practice...). The skill is more likely to succeed on a backstab than a circle.
It is also quite likely to succeed when the victim is asleep or paralyzed.
There is always some chance of the skill being successful regardless of how
high level the opponent may be.

NOTE1: The skill does not guarantee the Assassin will kill the victim, it
only improves what damage it is POSSIBLE to inflict(WHEN the skill succeeds).

NOTE2: This skill is also useful against a Shou-Lin with knowledge of the
art of the monkey. A success in assassination will counter the Shou-Lins
art of the monkey skill on a backstab attempt(but not any other skills).

BERSERK

Usage       : berserk
Description :

   This ability, available only to high level warriors, allows the warrior to
enter into a fighting frenzy. This has a number of benefits and drawbacks:

* The warrior can not flee, use magical items, nor will he or she "wimpy"
  from combat.
* The warrior's enhanced damage skill is almost twice as likely to
  succeed while berserked.
* The warrior's 2nd and 3rd attacks *always* succeed.
* The warrior immediately gains 2hps/level. When he/she comes out of the rage,
  these hps are lost; this could result in the warrior becoming mortally wounded
  from injuries sustained earlier.
* Using this ability drains the warrior's stamina, causing them to lose moves
  (which they can, of course, recover).

   When warriors already under the effects of berserk use this skill a second
time, it causes them to enter a full-out blood rage.  For a short duration, they
will do substantially more combat damage.  Finally, the warrior isn't particularly
calm and collected while in a blood rage, and will suffer significant reduction
in successful attacks if he can't see his opponent.

Usage       : blackjack <victim>

BLOODBOWL

The &01BloodBowl&00  By Baal

 &09Game Play&00:

         The game consist of two teams.  Gold and Black are the team
         colors.

         There will be an offense and a defense which will be settled
         by a coin toss.

         At the start of the game, the Imm will punt the bloodball
         somewhere into the 300 room field.  The Offense will have
         exactly 60 seconds to recover/find the ball.  At 60 seconds
         the defense will be allowed to enter the field to try to
         recover the ball if the offense has not recovered it.  If the
         ball is picked up before the 60 seconds are up, the defense
         will be allowed onto the field to try to stop the offense
         from reaching the "BloodZone".

         When a player is killed, they will be sent to the "penalty
         box".  They will remain in the penalty box for a set amount
         of time.  At the end of that time, you will be transfered
         back to the "start", fully restored.  At that time you can
         re-enter the game by going up in to the playing field.

         Coding has been added to help everyone out.
         When a player picks up the ball the following message will be
         displayed:

         <Playername> <team color> has recovered the ball.

         When a player is killed or drops the ball:

         <Playername> <team color> has fumbled/dropped the ball.

         When a player give the ball to another player:

         <Playername> <team color> has handed off the ball to <playername>.

         When a player "throws" (passes) the ball to another player in a diff
         room:

         <Playername> <team color> passes the ball to <playername>.

&10Rules&00:
	(Immortals have the right to add, remove or change any rules they see fit
	at any time before, during or after the game.)

	There are not many rules, but the rules we have and will add or remove are:

	1. No recalling, which you shouldn't be able to do.
	2. No mobs are allowed to carry the ball.
	3. Disarming will be agreed upon by the captains or Imm.
	4. No teleporting others.

&11Misc&00:
	No experience is lost during this game.

	Captains:
	At the beginning of the game, the players will be asked to volunteer
	to be a captain or the Imm will choose the captains.  At that
	time the Imm will sort out pick order.


&08Scoring&00:
         To score, the offense must get the bloodball into the Bloodzone.

         When the offense enters the Bloodzone they will receive 1 point.
         For each minute the offense can keep the ball in the bloodzone
         they will receive 1 point up to 6, therefore a total of 7 points
         can be gained.  If the defense recovers the ball in the bloodzone
         during those 6 minutes a safety will be awarded to the defense,
         giving them 2 points.

&12Field Layout&00:
         Think of the Bloodbowl as a 4 story building.
         The first floor is the bloodzone (where you score).
         The 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors are the playing field, each
         consisting of 100 rooms.

&13Credits&00:
         I have had some help with this idea an I would like to thank you all.
         Old Picric helped me at the start and some of you have given me
         some great ideas.  Things will change and things will stay the same.
         Just relax and enjoy yourself.

   These are channels reserved for specific purposes.  Messages on these
channels reach everyone who is monitoring them.  The CHANNELS command gives a
brief description of each channel, lists its toggle command, and displays
whether you have it on or off.

The GUILD channel allows you to ask questions, converse, etc. among
other players who are the same class as yourself.

QUERY is NOT anonymous to all other mortals so feel embarrassed
about asking a 'dumb' question, but you know the saying, "there is no such
thing as a dumb question".  Players are able to talk on the
ROLEPLAY and OOC channels once they reach level 5.

Accumulative: No
Duration    : Instantaneous
Description :

This spell raises a fallen foe to fight for you.  Due to the tricky
nature of the spell, the raised creature will be unstable, and will
not last long.  More powerful creatures are also harder to hold
together, and the spell may fail entirely, destroying the corpse in
the process.

This command allows an Immortal to remove any object, either from the target's

CIRCLE

Usage      : Circle <victim>
Description:

   Use of this skill allows an Assassin to sneak past the combat defenses of
a fighting creature and backstab it. In this case the attack isn't necessarily
a stab in the back, but a shot in a weak and totally unprotected spot. You may
only use this skill if you are currently NOT being attacked, you however can
be attacking someone (but they must be attacking someone else).
   The damage multiplier for this skill is one less than that for a backstab.

Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Danny Baker, for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Brett Turner, for managing the CircleMUD Mailing List.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven, for porting the code to the Amiga.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns, for allowing Circle to exist.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- And, of course, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

CLAN CLANS

Clans are groups of mortals that have joined together for mutual benefit.
Clans vary in size and purpose.  Each clan has a clanhall that is a place
of safety and privacy. Only members of the clan may enter.  The benefits of
clans are great and thus so are the costs.  Use the 'help clan costs' command
to view the cost of purchase and upgrades.  To join an existing clan, contact
a current member.  To view a list of current clans, use the clanlist command.

corpse, though they will be flagged as HUNTED for doing so.

    Your corpse will remain where it fell for seven days, after which
it will disappear when the MUD crashes or is restarted.  Before this
time is up, it will be reloaded when the MUD comes back up.

DEATH

   This is what happens when you lose a fight! When you die, a corpse of
yourself is created in the location you died in and all your items are
transferred to it. Death can be a rather traumatic experience(just ask anyone
you know who is dead!), but thankfully in this world you have a soul which
allows you to re-enter the game once more after dying, albeit in a weakened
state. Apart from leaving your equipment in your corpse(which you would be
advised to try and retrieve!), you will also suffer a loss of experience,
how much you lose is dependent upon your class and level(basically, the more
you need to level, the more you can lose). You also don't suffer such a severe
xp loss if you are killed by a player instead of a monster... this is largely
to prevent you suffering TOOO severely as a result of being player killed.

If this xp loss brings you to 0(or less!) xp, then unfortunately your
very soul is destroyed and you will truly die... It's best not be too
scornful of being slain repetitively!

forth by Paladine. They still believe in their honor, but they have turned

healing and protection, Death Knights usually favor magic that harms and
destroys.

   This is the most powerful form of dark magic available to the Death
Knight class. The Death Knight reaches out and touches his victim, causing
the victim's very life force to drain away. If the victim fails their saving
throw, their body is so traumatized by the spells deadly effects that they
are effectively aged 100 years. They will suffer all the ill effects this
additional age brings to bear upon them. Nothing but the passage of time
will alleviate the horrific effects of a death touch.  The spell lasts six
hours per cast.

DELETE

   In order to maintain reasonable hard disk usage, characters that haven't
been on for a while are automatically deleted. How long this takes depends on
the characters level:

Lvl 1:     3 days
Lvl 2-4:   14 days
Lvl 5-10:  30 days
Lvl 11-25: 60 days
Lvl 26-45: 120 days
Lvl 46-50: 180 days

If you use the cryogenist instead of renting, then regardless of level your
character will not be deleted for 180 days(your items are NOT saved after 30
days).

If you rented (not using the cryogenist) then your items will be lost after 30
days or if you can't pay rent for that long. Your character may still exist
though, depending upon their level.

You can also delete your own character from the main menu. Note that this all
has NOTHING to do with rent which is handled separately) and it's quite
possible to be deleted before your equipment times out.  The final way you can
be deleted is if you break the rules and a God decides to delete you for
it. This isn't common, don't break the rules and you'll have nothing to worry
about.

DEX

   Dexterity is an ability score representing a combination of a character's
agility, reflexes, hand-eye coordination, balance and reaction speed. This
ability is a prime requisite for thieves as their skills are of a highly
dexterous nature. Dexterity affects a character's reaction to a threat or
surprise, and the ability to dodge an enemy's blows (affects AC). Dexterity

slowed, making it last significantly longer than it would
naturally.  As well, its weight is reduced to nearly nothing.

Each embalming will structurally weaken the corpse, effectively
reducing the hit points of the mobs' body.  This will make the
corpse less useful for consumption, exploding, and of course
charming.

FLAGGAME GAMES

RavenMUD relies heavily on quests to keep the player base entertained. One
popular game that can be run is the flag game. Below are some very simplistic
steps you can take to run such a game.

Step 1. Gather all interested players to the Quest for Glory room located
        8en of Samsera Center and use the command 'quest active'.  Tell all
        players to turn their quest flags on.  This will also turn on the
        quest channel.  All game updates, scores, and game discussion will
        take place on this channel.

Step 2. Use the command 'flag start'.  You MUST do this before assigning teams
        or they will not show up on the scoreboard.

Step 3. Choose teams or pick captains and let the mortals pick teams.  If
        there is an uneven amount of players, you may choose to have one or
        more Rogue players.  Once teams are chosen, assign each player a
        BLACK TEAM, GOLD TEAM, or ROGUE flag using the set command.  Each
        team member also gets a key to their fortress.  Following aliases will
        expedite this process.

If you have the 'reimb' command.
fgold   * set $1 team gold;reimb $1 20000
fblack  * set $1 team black;reimb $1 20100

If you do not have the 'reimb' command
fgold   * set $1 team gold;load o 20000;tell $1 get gold key
fblack  * set $1 team black;load o 20100;tell $1 get black key

Step 4. After teams are set, announce on the quest channel how long the game
        will last.  It is normally ended after x number of captures or after
        x number of minutes.  20-30 minutes is a good game length.  Then
        transfer each team into it's own fortress, start the game, and goto
        the Staging Area (room 20098) for the duration of the game.

This alias is an easy way to start the game.
fstart  * goto 20174;transquest black restore;goto 20074;transquest gold
          restore;goto 20098;qsay BEGIN!

Step 5. During the game, you can periodically use the 'flag score' command
        to show the score to all players.  When the game is over, award QP
        to each team.  Usually around 4 points for the winners and 2 for the
        losers.  Do this using the 'flag award <team> <amount>' command.

Step 6. After the game is over and QP are awarded.  Transfer all players to
        the Decontamination Station (room 1489).

Alias to send all players to Decontamination Station.
fend    * goto 1489;transquest all restore

GROUP

Usage       : GROUP [player]
	      GROUP all
Description :

   GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for killing
monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be shared among
group members that are in the same location, at the time of the killing
blow. Sharing is regardless of whether the group members have been
participating in the fight.

Group with no argument shows a list of people with whom you are grouped.
"group all" groups all people who are following you.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael > follow dragon
Redferne> follow dragon
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  > group dragon
Dragon  > group redferne
Dragon  > group quifael

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the time)
he types 'Group Quifael' to kick Quifael out of the group.

GUARD

You no longer need to set a guard up in the code. This can be easily achieved "In
Game". First of all you need to pick what mobile will be the guard. You need to
set the mobile with one of the following flags (from the MEDIT menu):

GUARD_CLASS - Will only let the class of the (guard) mobile pass in a certain direction.
GUARD_RACE - Will only let the race of the (guard) mobile pass in a certain direction.
GUARD_BOTH - Will only let the race/class of the (guard) mobile pass in a certain
direction.

Next you need to set the direction and block message of the mobile. This is done in the
room the mobile will recide in. You will set the following in the Extra Descriptions wihtin
the room. Use the messages in blue as the keyword in each Extra description. The direction
and text sent to player(s) will go in the description option. NOTE: $N is used to designate
the mobile name, while $n is used to designate a player name.

&11block_msg_room&00 - Set description that will be sent to room when said player is blocked.
&11block_msg_char&00 - Set description sent to player when blocked.
&11block_dir&00 - Set direction the mobile will block (north, south, east, west, up, down).

Samsera where he instructed the Ranger Guildmaster on the intricate details in
what he named, The Hands of the Wind.

HEDIT HELP-EDITOR

Usage: hedit <keyword>

   This command allows online editing of help files. Hedit OLC permission is
888.  When editing a help file entry the first line must list all keywords
(see "help help file" for a template).  There should be a space between each
keyword, but keywords themselves cannot have spaces. Using a "-" will let
the code know the argument will come in a string with spaces. Do not use /f
or /fi in hedit. Also, when editing an existing help file, you MUST use hedit
on the first listed keyword for the changes to save.  For example, if you
want to edit the MAGE help file, you would first type "help mage" and you
would see the following keywords:

MAGIC-USER MAGICUSER WIZARD MAGE

So, to edit this file, you need to "hedit magic-user".  If you "hedit mage",
it will not save.

HUNTED

   If you loot another players' corpse without consent, you will become
hunted. The flag will last 8 ticks (this value may well change). During
this time, it is not possible to leave the game except through death.
Dying does not end the HUNTED flag, only the passage of time does(and that
means time in the game). In addition, certain town guards will attack you
and shopkeepers will not deal with you. It is also not possible to enter
peace rooms while the flag is in effect. Basically this is to give the
victims of player kills the opportunity to exact vengeance upon you, although
it will be up to them to take advantage of the opportunity.  Hunted players
are also completely unable to transfer equipment in any way while their flag
lasts. You also cannot junk items in this time - junk was not a command
created for players exacting vengeance on one another. It is somewhat
unrealistic to destroy 20 magical items in a second. Of course, once the
HUNTED flag wears off, you are free to do what ever you wish with any items
you may have.

IMMPOLICY

Imm Policy - 3rd Draft

1.  Absolutely NO helping mortals out to an unfair advantage!
This includes:
-  setting stats, practices, hitpoints, damage, ac, exp., etc.
-  giving, selling or auctioning equipment to mortals
-  giving money to mortals
-  assisting mortals in killing mobiles/monsters or other players
-  give away hints and clues to locations, quests, eq, secret
   doors..etc.
-  corpse retrievals are up to your own descretion, use your best
   judgement.
You are allowed to help mortals when doing CR's, if required.
IE: locked doors, no key repop, etc.

2.  Switching into a mobile is a power given to you to make the
game more interesting to mortals. Care must be taken to play the
role of the mobile, don't act silly, or say "hey! it's me Joe!"
Be sure NOT to do anything to make the mobile harder or easier to
kill and never reveal statistics of the mobile to any players...
ie: hit points, gold, items carried, hitroll/damroll etc. Do not
do this just to interfere with a run

3.  Set a good example for the mortals... You are there to keep
an eye on things...moderate the chat channels, break up
arguments, get rid of nuisance players... etc.

4.  Keep an eye on other immortals. Do NOT police them! Report
any problems to a higher god, or to me. Send me an email:
fairy1@earthlink.net if need be.

5.  We are all here to have fun. There are certain rules to
ensure that players don't get out of hand, and ruin the game for
everyone. There are also rules for you to make sure that you
don't ruin the game for everyone either. Use your own common
sense. If in question, ask a higher level god.
Immortality is a privilage, not a right.

6.  The use of any punishment commands on another imm is
forbidden and is immediate grounds for a demotion or being
mortalized. These commands have been given to you as a means for
punishing mortals only. If there is a problem with an immortal,
get in touch with ME.

7.  There are two kinds of Immortal Mortals -

		- Altered Immortal Mortals -

    Immortals are allowed to set their mortals stats, gold hitpoints
    etc.
    Immortals are allowed to load eq, potions, etc. for their
    mortals.
    Immortals are NOT allowed to auction, exchange, trade, give or
    sell any of this to other mortals.
    Immortal mortals that are altered must be known to the public as
    an Imm mortals.

		- Unaltered Immortal Mortals -

    Any Imm mortal that has had no altering can play as any mortal
    does.

8.  An Immortal's mortal altered or unaltered, can NOT
participate in any of that Immortal's quests or any quests he
helped create.

9.  Unaltered Immortals' Mortals may be *members* of clans.
Not Leaders or Officers.

10. Any information you gain with your immortal should not be
shared with, or used to benefit, any mortal.

11. You are responsible for everything you do! So if you act
foolishly, you have to pay the consequences. Denying your actions
will be treated as damaging the integrity.

Immortals are expected to enforce the rules of the mud, as well
as comply with them.

INN INNS CRYOGENIC CRYO RECEPTION

   Inns are places where the weary traveler may rest while the innkeeper looks
after his equipment and treasure.

Specifically, the game will save your equipment while you are logged out.
There is a daily cost for renting, based on your equipment.  Each item has
a per diem charge.  The per diem charge is calculated to the nearest second,
however -- if you rent at the rate of 2400 coins per day, and you come back
39 hours later, you will be charged 3900 coins.

A CRYOGENIC CENTER will store your items for a one-time charge of four
days rent.

Rent files are deleted if you run out of money to pay the per diem charges
or after 45 days.  Cryogenic-rent files are deleted after 180 days.

LINK LAG

   A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

 I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
    time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
    will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
    reconnect to the game.

II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution we
    can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
    breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is initiated.

    Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
    reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
    cut your link.

NOTE: HUNTED players are NOT saved by divine forces when they are missing
      their link(see help hunted).

 9) GROUP           NPC is grouped. System flag. DO NOT USE!
10) CURSE           Mobile is perma CURSED. Probably not something you want to put
                    on your mobile.
11) INFRA           Mobile has perma INFRAVISION. Check MEDIT_RACES. Mobile will be

12) POISON          Mobile will be affected by poison.

14) PROT-GOOD       Good players will take damage when they hit the mobile.
15) SLEEP           I wouldn't use it :|
16) !TRACK          Stops the skill TRACK from working on the mobile.
17) FLY             Mobile will be perma FLY, enabling them to walk across "FLIGHT"
                    territory.
18) REGEN           Increases HP and MANA regeneration.
19) SNEAK           Mobile will use sneak when moving through rooms.
20) HIDE            Players will be unable to see mobile unless affected by SENSE
                    LIFE (within 15 levels).
21) HASTE           Mobile will gain an additional attack.
22) CHARM           System flag used in conjuction with spell CHARM. Do NOT use.
23) SHIELD          Reduces magic damage by 1/3rd.
24) PARA            Mobile will be perma paralyzed.
25) AIRSPHERE       Mobiles do not "drown" underwater, so this flag does nothing.
26) PLAGUE          Mobile will be PLAGUED.
27) DONTSET         Just what it means.
28) SILENCE         Mobile will be unable to cast spells.
29) MOUNTED         Another system flag. Do NOT use!
30) WARD            Damage will be reduced by 25%.
31) SHAD_SPH        Mobile will be perma SHADOW SPHERED. Players/NPC's will only be
                    able to see mobile if within 15 levels of mobile.
32) BERSERK         Mobile will be perma BERSERK.

                    resistant to magic. Does not give armor bonus or mana bonus.
47) APOCALYPSE      Perma "AURA OF APOCALYPSE". I never thought this worked, even on
                    players and it seems to do even less here since it doesn't give an
                    armor bonus.

54) WRAITHFORM      Will increase mana regeneration per tick.
55) DISEASE         Mobile will be affected by DISEASE.
#51
MEDIT_ALIAS

An alias is the word you use to act on a mob. For example the alias: "balrog
demon flaming" would allow the following commands to work: kill balrog, look
flaming, consider demon, etc. etc. Don't confuse this with the display name
of the mobile, the mobile alias = keywords.
#51
MEDIT_ALIGN

Mobile alignment can range from 1000 to -1000. The alignment of the mob will
affect player alignment if the mobile is killed.

1000 = holy
0 = neutral
-1000 = satanic
#51
MEDIT_ARMOR

Armor can be set from 100 to -2,000. The lower the armor class the less likely a
player will be able to hit that mobile. Anything beyond -100 armor will give the
mobile damage reduction. For example -200 armor would result in -10 damage taken
when the mobile is hit. This option will also affect experience and gold on the
mobile.
#51
MEDIT_ATTACKS

This controls the description of violence given during battles, in
messages such as "The builders assistant bites you very hard." Attack
should be one of the following numbers:

 0) hit              1) sting            2) whip             3) slash
 4) bite             5) bludgeon         6) crush            7) pound
 8) claw             9) maul            10) thrash          11) pierce
12) blast           13) punch           14) stab            15) strangle
16) tear            17) squeeze         18) stomp           19) drain
20) bite            21) burn            22) impale          23) kick

The attack type doesn't much matter on a mobile, although it will play more of a
roll when defining weapon type.
#51
MEDIT_CLASS

You can currently select all the classes of RavenMUD. Thief, Warrior, Shou-Lin,
Solamnic Knight, Death Knight, Shadow Dancer, Assassin, Ranger, Cleric,
Magic User, Necromancer. Class determines what skills/spells the mobile will
use in combat. By default the class for a mobile will be set to "MAGIC USER".
#51
MEDIT_CLASS

You can currently select all the classes of RavenMUD. Thief, Warrior, Shou-Lin,
Solamnic Knight, Death Knight, Shadow Dancer, Assassin, Ranger, Cleric,
Magic User, Necromancer. Class determines what skills/spells the mobile will
use in combat. By default the class for a mobile will be set to "MAGIC USER".

When using the set command, the classes are mapped to the following letters:

A) Assassin
C) Cleric
D) Death Knight
H) Shadow Dancer
M) Magic User
K) Solamnic Knight
R) Ranger
S) Shou-Lin
T) Thief
W) Warrior
N) Necromancer

#0
MEDIT_DAMAGE

Damage will calculate how hard the mobile hits an NPC or player in combat. Damage
is calculated with the number of dice by dice size, with an additional static
damage number. The static damroll cannot exceed 100. Mobiles can NOT do beyond
200 damage per hit. The only way to break this cap is by setting their level
to 51.

Example:

Number of dice = 10 Dice size 3 Damroll 8
((10*3)+10/2)+8 = 28 Avg

Max Number of attacks for each class:
Mu  Cl  Th  Wa  Ra  As  Sl  Kn  Dk  Sd  Nm
3   3   3   4   3   3   4   3   3   3   3

Damage Table:

miss - 0
scratch       - 1-2
barly         - 3-4
hit           - 5-6
hard          - 7-10
very hard     - 11-14
extremly hard - 15-19
massacre      - 20-26
stagger       - 27-35
bone crush    - 36-47
oblliterate   - 48-59
enshroud      - 60-99
charge        - 100-150
mutilate      - 151-200
destroy       - 201-300
annihilate    - 301-400
vapourize     - 401-500
ruin          - 501+

This setting will also affeect exp and gold on the mobile.
#51
MEDIT_DDESC

The description displayed for a mobile when a player looks at the mobile by
typing "look <mobile>." When entering this description you will use the text
editor. So all commands under /h are once again available to you. As always
with the text editor use /fi to format and indent your work. Try to liven up
your mob by writing a creative description.

Try to tell the player what the mobile looks like, how it is acting, etc...
Be careful how you word what they are wearing. For example of what not to say:
"A huge werewolf is wielding a mace of Oblivion." Reason being, if he does not
load the mace, this would not make any sense. Do not describe objects that a
mob is wearing in their look or extra desc. All such objects should actually
be made and equipped to the mob.
#51
MEDIT_DEFAULT

Default position is the position to which monsters will return after a
fight, which should be one of the same numbers as given for mobile
position. In addition, the Default Position defines when the mob's long
description is displayed. For example if a mob is sleeping it will not show
the l-desc, instead it will display "<<s-desc>> is <<position>>."

Aggro mobs can be simulated by loading them sitting and agressive,
with a default position of standing.  After being attacked, they will
wander around instead of sitting back down!
#51
MEDIT_HITROLL

Hitroll will determine how often a mobile will hit another player or mobile.

The following is a chart showing how often a mobile will hit. Don't
forget that spells and skills can reduce a mobiles hitroll. For example blind
will reduce a mobiles hitroll by -4.

15 HR - 75 percent
16 HR - 86 Percent
18 HR - 87 Percent
19 HR - 96 percent
21 HR - 97 Percent
#51
MEDIT_HP

Mobile HitPoints work in the same fashion as mobile damage. Number of HP
dice, size of HP dice, and an additional static HitPoints. You cannot go above
32000 HP's or the console will make you input your dice again.
#51
MEDIT_LDESC

This is what you see when you look at the room with the mob in it.
Unlike the Short Description, the long description must end with proper
punctuation, and be a complete sentence with proper grammar. Remember that
the long description will follow the room description.

Example:
An angry citizen runs around in circles.

This is what the player will see when they enter the room. If the mobile is
resting or sleeping the long description will not display.
#51
MEDIT_LEVEL

The level option will allow you to set the level of your mob. Default level is 0
so make sure you set this option! You can set a mob's level from 1-51. This will
have an effect on how much experience and gold a player will receive after killing
the mobile. Level will also multiply the mana pool for the mobile. Last, but
certainly not least, level will determine what skills/spells the mobile will use.

Mobiles between the levels of 46 to 51 will load with maximum racial stats. Mobiles
between levels 45 and 1 will load with random stats, up to their racial max. Mobile
stats are generated during a reboot, so changes you make to level will not be visible
until than.

MEDIT_NPCFLAGS

NPC stands for Non Player Characters. You can set multiple flags on a mobile.

 1) SPEC        Before the days of "DG SCRIPTS", mobiles that followed a special
                procedure had to be done in the code and this flag identified the
                mobile the procedure was attached to. Do Not Use this flag, instead
                use the dg script.
 2) SENTINEL    Mobile will not leave the room.
 3) SCVNGR      The mob should pick up valuables it finds on the ground.  More
                expensive items will be taken first.
 4) ISNPC       Default is on, do not change. System flag!
 5) AWARE       Mobile cannot be backstabbed.
 6) AGGR        Mob will hit all players in the room it can see. Mobile cannot be
                summoned.
 7) STAYZ       Mob will not leave its zone. All mobs should have this flag or
                the SENTINEL flag. This keeps AGGRESSIVE mobs from wandering
                into a newbie zone.
 8) WIMP        Mob will flee if it has less than 20% of its hitpoints.
 9) AGG_E       Mobile will be aggressive to alignment -350 or lower (evil
                alignment).
10) AGG_G       Mobile will be aggressive to alignment 350 or greater (good
                alignment).
11) AGG_N       Mobile will be agressive to an alignment between -349 to 349
                (neutral alignment)
12) SEEKR       Mobile will track player if hit. Do not use in conjuction with
                MEMORY or the mobile will NOT track.
13) HELPER      The mob will attack any player it sees in the room that is fighting
                with a mobile in the room. Useful for groups of mobiles that travel
                together. This will also make cleric mobiles heal other mobs.
14) !CHRM       Flag will stop players from using the spell CHARM or CHARM CORPSE on
                the mobile.
15) !SUMN       Will be unable to summon mobile.

                combat if they should run into them again.
21) SUPAGG      This flag DOES NOT work, unless mobile set in the code.
22) MOUNT       This flag is used to make a mobile mountable. In most cases should not
                be used.
23) CLONE       This flag is used by the system when a player file is cloned. DO NOT
                USE!
24) PREDATOR    Mobile is aggressive to everyone. Will target weakest player in room.
25) GUARD_CLASS Mob will block players not of his class. More Info see help file &08GUARD&00.
26) GUARD_RACE  Mob will block players not of his race. More Info see help file &08GUARD&00.
27) GUARD_BOTH  Mob will block players not of his race or class. More Info see help file &08GUARD&00.
28) QUESTMASTER Flag needed on mobiles for them to give out quests.
29) NPC_KILLER  Flag designed to make mobiles assist player. Currently NOT working.
30) !NOX        This makes a mobile immune to the spell nox.

                seconds at any players in adjacent rooms.
#51

Position is the state of the mobile when it is first loaded, which should
be one of the following numbers:

0) Dead             - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.
1) Mortally wounded - Reserved for internal use. Do not set.

Select the race of your mobile, default is set to human. Some racial abilities do
not work for mobiles. Refer to the list below for more information.

 0) Human     Default Race.
 1) Plant     NPC only Race, currently has no specials

22) Drow      Perma sneak INDOORS. Does NOT have increased mana regeneration.
              Posses perma infravision.
#51
MEDIT_SDESC

The description of the mobile used by the MUD when the mobile takes some
action.  For example, a short description of "the angry citizen" would
result in messages such as "The angry citizen departs north." and "The
angry citizen hits you hard." The Short Description should never end
with a punctuation mark or be capitalized because it will be inserted into
the middle of sentences such as those above. Of course if you give the mobile
a proper name, such as Lord Vulture, than you should use capitalization here.
#51
MEDIT_SEX

Will give the option to set the gender of the mobile. Currently, you can create
male, female, or neutral (Non-Gender) characters. By default the gender of the
mobile will default to "neutral". The sex of the mob determines the pronoun when
it performs an action "he, she, it" for example.
#51
MEDIT_SKILLSUC

You can now define how often your mobile will have success at executing a skill
or casting a spell. You can set this field from 0 to 100. That being 0 having
no spell/skill success or 100, having complete skill/spell success. For example,
if you set Smash 'Skill Suc' to 50, he would have a 50% chance to kick another
player or mobile, otherwise he fails at the skill (also causing a stun). This is
also calculated into the exp and gold table.
#51
MEDIT_SPELLDAM

Spell Dam Defines the damage dealt by a mobile when casting a spell. If
you set it to 100, the mob will do 100% of its regular damage when it casts
spells.  If you set it to 400%, the mob will be casting spells for 4x the regular
damage. THIS VALUE MULTIPLIES EQUIPMENT BONUSES.  So if you have a mob wielding a
staff with +60% spell damage, the mob is doing 160% spell damage before you add
that multiplier.  If you set the multiplier to 400%, the mob will now do
1.6 * 4 = 6.4x its usual damage.

When mobs cast for less than 100% of their damage, the cost of the spell is
reduced accordingly. This means if a mob casts for 50% spell damage, they'll
spend 50% of the mana.
#51
MEDIT_SRACE

Subraces are only available to dragons, draconians, and elementals. If the
subrace is NOT set, than the subrace will not do their racial attack. Refer
to the table below to see what type of breath/spell they will
use.


 0) None            Dragon          Draconian       Elemental
 1) Red Dragon      Fire            Fire            Fire E
 2) Green Dragon    Gas             Gas             Air E
 3) White Dragon    Frost           Frost           Water E
 4) Black Dragon    Acid            Acid            Earth E
 5) Blue Dragon     Lightning       Lightning
 6) Chromatic Drago 1-3 different
 7) Gold Dragon     Fire
 8) Silver Dragon   Frost
 9) Bronze Dragon   Lightning
10) Copper Dragon   Acid
11) Brass Dragon    Gas
12) Shadow Dragon   Gas

a meditating monk can relax and rest the same as if they were asleep, yet
remaining fully cognizant of the world around them.

MELD

Usage       : meld <item> <item>
Description :

   When you find certain items, you can meld them together to make
a different item.

Example: meld gem sword
Poof, Avernus appears in your hand.

METAPHYSICIAN META

Usage       : buy <meta attr> <object>
Description :

   The Metaphysician specializes in affecting and modifying the very core of a
your being. This is no small feat and is accomplished by taking an object and
channeling its arcane energy until the magic contained within is released. The
resultant energy burst is then directed into you thus permanently affecting
you at a very primitive level.  Unfortunately, the object used in the
channeling is destroyed and in some cases the character suffers a loss of
experience but the gains more than make up for it.

It should be noted that some items require less effort on the part of the
Metaphysician due to the high level of magic contained therein.  Because of
this, you may experience discounted rates from various items, but only
experimentation will tell. All of the rates listed above are in millions and
N/A means that that cost is non-applicable for that attribute. That's right,
sate and soak are gold and EQ items, there isn't an experience investment on
your part.

It should also be noted that the Metaphysician must deal directly with the
Gods and therefore can be quite cranky at times. Before you purchase anything
from him make CERTAIN that you read the 'terms' or suffer the consequences.
There will be no recourse for anyone foolish enough to tempt fate by doubting
what the Metaphysician states in his terms are not law as he understands it.

These days, the Metaphysician demands that his customers have been favoured
by the Gods with a number of Quest Points also.  The number of Quest Points
depends on the item used and the procedure requested.

METEOR METEOR-SWARM

Usage        : cast 'meteor swarm'
Accumulative : -
Duration     : Instant

this ability costs a few movement points.

MUCKLE

Usage       : muckle
Description:

This is an automated quest ran by an Immortal. The objective is to be the
muckle. The first player to enter the arena is the "MUCKLE". The MUCKLE must do
his or her best to avoid being killed. When the muckle is killed, the killer
becomes the new MUCKLE.  The longer a player is the MUCKLE, the slower a player
is able to move (forcing him or her to engage in combat instead of run).

Your rewards for playing are the following:
 2QP for winning
 1QP for each minute you are the muckle
 1QP for any amount of seconds you were the muckle

To see the scoreboard, use the muckle command. Players who have scored will
be listed, with an asterisk beside the current muckle.  The game's duration is
also listed.

To receive all game information, turn your quest flag on using the 'QUEST' command.

MULTI-LINKING MULTI-PLAYING

   Here at RavenMUD we do NOT allow ANY form of multi-linking. You may
only have one character on at a time, PERIOD. You may create and play as
many characters as you want, but THEY MAY NOT DIRECTLY INTERACT WITH EACH
OTHER IN ANY WAY.

Multi-linking is having two or more characters logged into the mud from
the same end-source at the same time.  In other words, if you have more than
one character and one character is logged in, you may not log in another
character until the first character is completely logged off.  A link-dead
character is still logged in.  An idle character is also still logged in.

Penalties will include forfeiture of all equipment, and may include
deletion of the offending characters.

MUTE

MUTE is used to shut a player up; if a player is muted, he/she will not be
able to use most communication channels until he/she is unmuted.

NECRO NECROMANCER

   This is a class that uses the power released by death and decay to
perform many tasks.  Having similar training in magic to the Magic
Users, Necromancers can perform a number of similar spells.  However,
they quickly branch out into corpse manipulations and poisons, leaving
the powerful damage spells for their more pure brethren.

when you reach the appropriate level:

NECROMANCER-ADVANCE NECRO-ADVANCE WITCH-DOCTOR REVENANT 

   When your necromancer reaches advancement level 1, you may choose to specialize
as a Witch Doctor or Revenant.

**WITCH DOCTOR**  Summoned mobs have 2% more health per advancement (this does
                  not increase the chance of the corpse crumbling).

Gain access to the following skills/spells according to advancement level.

[1] metamorphosis                       [6]
[2]                                     [7]

[5] enhanced reanimation                [10]

Metamorphosis
           - You may sacrifice a charmed corpse to incorporate some of its
             deadly nature into your being.  This increases your melee damage
             output significantly for a short time.  May only be cast once
             every three ticks.
Sacrifice Pet
           - You may sacrifice a charmed corpse to protect you from harm.
             Lasts one tick or until you take enough damage to dispel the
             shield.  The strength of the shield is determined by the size
             of the corpse.  Charming another corpse ends this effect.
Reanimation
           - Charmed corpses have increased skill success and spell damage.


**REVENANT**  +2 spell damage per advancement level.

Gain access to the following skills/spells according to advancement level.

[1] dark knowledge                      [6]
[2]                                     [7]
[3] improved consume corpse             [8]
[4]                                     [9]
[5] improved curse                      [10]

Dark Knowledge
           - While you control no pet, spell damage and healing from life
             drain are increased 30%.
Improved Consume Corpse
           - Some of the corpse may be left behind for 'seconds'.  Maximum
             health can increase temporarily based on the size of the corpse.
             Within the duration of this effect, a necromancer may consume
             as many corpses as he or she wishes to reach any arbitrary
             amount of hitpoints.
Improved Curse
           - Decreases a target's skill success by 15%.

NOSUMMON SUMMONABLE RECALLABLE NORECALL

Usage: nosummon/norecall

  RavenMUD allows player killing and looting! A player must protect themselves
from their foes or sometimes even a turned allie!.
  These toggles prevent people from summoning you and gives you a warning
message if someone tries.  If you want to let someone summon you (i.e. if
someone wants to summon you for a legitimate reason), type NOSUMMON to turn
off summon protection.  You can then type NOSUMMON again to turn protection
back on.

NOTE: Mobiles are not affected by player summon protection.

Norecall works just like nosummon, except it prevents another player from
recalling you instead.

If you're hunted, then you're not protected by the gods from any devious
things players might want to do to you.

SEE ALSO: HUNTED LOOTING TOGGLE CONSENT

NOTEAM

   This command can be used by players to remove them selves from the flag

has ended (so you no longer show up in jail etc.)

scrolls, and potions) to specify what message displayed to the room when the
magical item is used. If no Action Description is present, a default message
will be used:

Staves: Coil taps <object> three times on the ground.
Wands: Coil points <object> at Augustine.
Scrolls: Coil recites <object>.
Potions: Coil quaffs <object>.

For readable papers, the Action Description contains the text on the paper.
So unless your object is a staff, wand, scroll, potion, dust, or note; DO NOT USE.

A-desc is not seen by the person using the object. Only by the victim and other
players in the room. The following variables can be used with it.

$e he/she/it person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$E he/she target of staff/wand/scroll/potion
$m him/her person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$M him/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion
$n char name person using staff/wand/scroll/potion (your name)
$N char name target of staff/wand/scroll/potion (other persons name)
$s his/her/its person using staff/wand/scroll/potion
$S his/her target of staff/wand/scroll/potion

Example:
$n gulps down a potion of bloodlust.

OEDIT_AFFECTS

Objects can have perma affects. This menu gives every permanent affect
you can have on a piece of gear. Please keep in mind, when you give an item a
perma affect it will most likely take away from another class. You should see
Xiuhtecuhtli before you set a flag in this section.

OEDIT_CONTAINER

The container flag can be a little tricky and deserves a more in depth review. When
you enter the VALUES in OEDIT for a CONTAINER you will be asked how much weight the
container can hold, this will be a value between 1 and 10,000. After you set the
weight of the container you need to select the flags for the object. You will be
presented with the table below:


[  a]CLOSEABLE - This flag MUST be set set for the object to be opened and closed.
[  b]PICKPROOF - Stops Thieves from using the PICK skill.
[  c]CLOSED    - Object will load closed.
[  d]LOCKED    - Object will be locked when it loads. Don't forget to set the CLOSED
                 flag. Also, you will be asked in the next menu to set the key VNUM.
                 You MUST set a key, even if it is a pick only object. If you do not
                 set a key, the skill PICK will not work.
[  e]LOCKER    - This is set for LOCKER usage. If you set a locker you MUST set the
                 players name to access it using the "SET" command.
[  f]DIRTY     - This is a system flag for LOCKERS do not use!

After you have set the container flags you will be given an option to set the VNUM of
the key (-1 if it does not have one). Finally you will be asked if the object is
trapped. Enter level of trap (1-50) damage is equal to the amount that you would find
on a trap placed by an assassin.
#51
OEDIT_COST OEDIT_CDAY OEDIT_TIMER

9) Cost        : 0

   Amount of gold that will be charged per day when a character has rented.
   Maximum of 50000 coins per day.

B) Timer       : 0
   Used in conjuction with the TIMER flag. Item will disintegrate when the timer
   runs.
#51
OEDIT_DG

This menu will allow you to add a DG script to your object. To add a new trigger,
use the VNUM for the particular trigger you want to attach to the object. You can
have more than one DG script attached to an object. The menu will also allow you to
remove a trigger attached to an object. DG triggers will be covered more in depth
later in this tutorial.

the player.

#51
OEDIT_LDESC

The long description is displayed when the object is seen lying on the
ground, for example, "The tail of a puddie cat is lying here." Unlike the Short
Description, the Long Description should end with appropriate punctuation
and the first letter should be captitalized. Just like a full sentence with
proper grammar.
#51
OEDIT_MELD

Two objects can be "melded" together to make a new object. Below are the steps you
need to take to complete that process.

 1. Make 3 objects in oedit
    a. Main
    b. Insert
    c. New Object
 Example: sword, gem and Avernus
 2. After the 3 objects are made and saved to files, go back and oedit obj 1 (main)
    a. Goto Extra Flags (6) and flag obj "main_part"
    b. Goto Extra description menu (F) and start setting the keywords and
       Descriptions.
       Set 1 Keyword = new_item
       Set 1 Desc. = vnum of new object
       Set 2 Keyword = insert_item
       Set 2 Desc. = vnum of item to be melded with.
       Set 3 Keyword = insert_to_char
       Set 3 Desc. = message that player gets when object's meld.
       Set 4 Keyword = insert_to_room
       Set 4 Desc. = message the players in room get when objects meld.
       Set 5 Keyword = insert_fail_char
       Set 5 Desc. = message player gets when trying to meld to wrong objs.
       Set 6 Keyword = insert_fail_room
       Set 6 Desc. = message players in room get when wrong objs are trying to meld.
 3. Oedit obj 2 (insert)
    a. Goto Extra Flags (6) and flag obj Insert (40)
 4. Now you are done, unless you want more inserts, then you start over again, using
    your object 3 (New) as a Main by flagging it as main. Remember, you must make
    your objs before inserting vnum in to the Desc.

#51
OEDIT_NAME

List of keywords players can use to interact with the object.
#51
OEDIT_SDESC

The short description of an object is used by the MUD when the object is
acted upon. For example,  a short description of "a long, green stick" would
result in messages such as "The Balrog picks up a long, green stick."
The Short Description should never end with a punctuation mark or begin
capitalized because it will be inserted into the middle of a sentence.
#51
OEDIT_SKILLSUCC OEDIT_SPELLSUCC

When Skill_Success or Spell_Success is found on a player it automatically
increments the chance of doing a successful skill or spell.

Examples:

If you wear four items with +10 spell success, first you get four 1/10 chances
at the spell casting successfully.  Then you get the regular chance based on
the level the spell is practiced to.

Diminishing Returns: Yes we do have diminishing returns on spell/skill success,
look below for an example of how this will work.

The person's skill is at 80%.  If the person then wears seven pieces of gear with
+5 spell success, then it's 86%.  If a person wears seven +10 spell success items,
then it's about 90%. As another example, if the original skill is at 90% using the
same item mods as above, the skill becomes 93 - 95

As a rule of thumb, 10 is fantastic, around 5 should be used on pieces that are
solo or already have very nice stats.
#51
OEDIT_TYPE

This specifies what type the object is defined as; also controls the meanings
of value D in the OEDIT menu. See help file &08OEDIT_VALUES&00 for more info.

OEDIT_VALUES

OEDIT_WEAR

This defines where a piece of gear is worn. By default you will already have a TAKE flag.
If this is removed the item can not be picked up off the ground. An object can be worn in
multiple spots, but I recommend you only make it available for one slot.

Do not use the ORBITAL slot. This is for quest equipment only!
#51
OEDIT_WEIGHT

This defines the weight of the object. Before you set the weight on an object take some
time to analyze reality VS. game play. First of all, an iron shield shouldn't weigh 1 pound!
Yes, I've actually seen this in game. Second, contemplate racial stats for characters.
Obviously, some races will have greater strength than others. Strength directly correlates
with the weight they will be able to pick up. Also take into consideration weapon wield
strength which will be considerably lower than carry weight.
#51

POLICY

Post #511  Policies

All polices listed on this board are to be followed at all times.  Disobeying
a policy in any way will result in punishment.  The penalty will vary depending
on the IMMortal involved and the degree of the violation.


Post #512  Roboting

Roboting is using scripts or triggers to make your character function while you
are away from the keyboard.  This includes casting spells on others, practicing
skills or spells, assisting in combat, etc.  Triggers are fine, but you must be
at the keyboard.  If you are away from the keyboard, your character should be
idle or rented out.


Post #513  Profanity

There should be no profanity or racial slurs over any of the public channels.
This includes ooc, roleplay, query, quest, guild, using your title, and posting
on boards.  You may speak freely using says, emotes, group tells, and tells.


Post #514  Multilinking

Multilinking is forbidden in this realm.  Even briefly multilinking to pass
equipment or to cast a quick spell is NOT allowed.  Under no circumstances
are you permitted to have more than one character logged in at the same
time.  No exceptions.


Post #515  Circumventing HUNTED or THIEF Flags

These flags exist for a reason and it is illegal to attempt to bypass them.
If you loot or steal from another player, be prepared to deal with the
effects of these flags.  Trying to hide or transfer equipment in any way
before the flag runs out is illegal.


Post #516  Bug Exploitation

A bug is anything in the Mud that doesn�t function the way it was intended.
It is against policy to attempt to exploit a bug to benefit you or anyone
else.  All bugs should be reported immediately using the �bug� command (see
help bug).


Post #517  Killing Sub 20ths

It is illegal to pkill a player that is under 20th level.  This includes both
new characters and remorted characters.  If you wish to be protected by this
policy, you need to have your level visible on the wholist.  Low level players
that exploit this protection should be reported to an IMMortal.


Post #518  Passing EXP

Suiciding one character to a mob in order to pass exp to another character is
against policy.


Post #519  Character Jumping

Character jumping is logging off with one character and bringing on another
character to perform a certain task.  Due to the lack of players, the staff
will be flexible with this policy.    We will permit logging on your mage to
cast portal or logging on your thief to pick a quick lock, but do not push the
limits of this policy.  Extreme violations will be punished.  An example of
character jumping that is NOT allowed is using your high level tank to wound
exp mobs and then logging on your low level to take the kills.  Another form
of character jumping that is NOT allowed is logging on your caster to
scribe/brew/mix potions or scrolls to be used on another character.  If you
have a question about specifics of this policy, ask an IMMortal.


Post #5110  Disrespecting An IMMortal

It is a violation of policy to disrespect an IMMortal for any reason.  This
includes using public channels, posting on boards, etc.  Playing in this realm
is a privilege, not a right.  The IMMortal staff spends countless hours to add
new features and to make this world run smooth and stable.  If you disrespect
a member of the IMMortal staff, be prepared to be punished swiftly and severely.

QUEST

   This command lets you take quests from the various mobiles that give them.
If given by itself, it acts as a toggle to inform the Powers That Be that you
wish to participate in the currently running Quest.  If an immortal is running
a Quest and needs to know who wishes to participate, he/she will ask players
to turn on their Quest flags using this QUEST command if they are interested
in the Quest.  It also allows you to listen in on the quest channel and
receive information specific to the quest.

You can try to get a quest from a mobile by using the 'quest offer' command.
If you do get offered a quest, you can 'quest take' it or 'quest refuse' it.
If you take the quest, you will have a number of ticks to complete the tasks
given you.  If you change your mind about doing the quest, you can use
'quest abort' to cancel it.  At any point you can use 'quest info' to be
reminded of your quest tasks.

You must wait some time between each quest you do.  This time depends on
the quest you were offered and whether you took it or refused it.

> quest (to join a quest/the quest channel)
> quest offer
> quest take
> quest refuse
> quest abort

REDIT

REDIT invokes the room editor.  You should use the REDIT command in any
room in the zone you wish to edit.  Note that you must have builder
permission in that zone and only one person can edit the rooms in a
particular zone at a time.  Type REDIT SAVE "Zone#51" to save your rooms.
RavenMUD has some problems with the OLC crashing, so I suggest you save
often.

Examples
> redit
> redit save 30

#51
REDIT_CLAN

A numerical value is entered to identify a clan. Under normal circumstances this
should not be used. You will notice an *Invalid* tag in your room under the "Set
Clan ID". This is normal, leave it as is.
#51
REDIT_DESCRIPTION

The description of the room is seen when players type "look," and when they
enter. Select 2 to enter the room description while in redit. When you enter
the room description for the first time make sure to type /c and hit enter to
clear the current contents (You are in an unfinished room.) Do NOT clone rooms,
make sure you give your room an interesting description, and remember to use
proper grammar.
#51
REDIT_DG

This menu will allow you to add a DG script to your room. To add a new trigger,
use the VNUM for the particular trigger you want to attach to the room. You can
have more than one DG script attached to a room. The menu will also allow you to
remove a trigger attached to a room. DG triggers will be covered more in depth
later in this tutorial.
#51
REDIT_EXIT

The exit menu will allow you to link rooms together in your zone. You have the
option of linking a room north, south, east, west, down, and up. Look at the menu
below for more help.

1) Exit to     : 18007
2) Description :-
<NONE>
3) Door name   : <NONE>
4) Key         : -1
5) Door flags  : No door
6) Purge exit.
Enter choice, 0 to quit :

1) Use the VNUM of the room that will be linked.
2) When a character looks in direction of exit, will see the extra description.
   Great way of warning characters of imminent danger.
3) If you're using a door for the exit, put the keyword for the door here. This is
   the keyword the player will need to use when executing the "open" command. You may
   use multiple keywords.
4) Enter the VNUM of the object key to unlock/lock the door.
5) "No door" is default. "Closeable door" will put a door flag in the room. "Pickproof"
   will stop the skills "PICK LOCK", "DOOR BASH", and "SHADOWMIST". The door will load
   closed ONLY if you set it in ZEDIT. Make sure you also create a door flag in the
   room that you link to.
6) Removes the exit all together.
#51
REDIT_EXTDESC OEDIT_EXTDESC

Extra descriptions can be used to enhance an area. When a player types "look
"keyword"" they will be able to read another description. Extra descriptions
are great for dropping hints, clues, and "Easter bunny Eggs". I urge any serious
builder to use them frequently.


1) Keyword: <NONE>                    The keyword is what will allow a player to
                                      see the extra description when they type "look".
                                      Multiple keywords are allowed.
2) Description:                       This is where the actual text goes after they
                                      look at the keyword.
<NONE>
3) Goto next description: <NOT SET>   Creates a new extra description or cycles to the
                                      next extra description menu if one already exists.
Enter choice (0 to quit) :            Exits out of menu.

REDIT_FLAGS

Room flags can create a number of interesting scenarios. Make sure the flag fits the
room description. You can use multiple room flags in each room VNUM. Some room flags
do not work or the flag is used by the system. Make sure you carefully look over the
different variants below. Many new ones have been added and old flags modified since
the stock Circle.

1) DARK              The room will be dark, removing penalties from Drow and
                     Vampire races. Will require infravision or light to
                     see in room.
2) DEATH             Known as the "DT", will cause instant death when player moves
                     into the room.
3) !MOB              Mobiles will not enter room *unless* they are seeking a
                     player. This flag will seriously screw up a mobile
                     that tries to mist to a player. They will jump all over the place until
                     the player leaves the room.

                     this flag.
8) !MAGIC            Spells will not work in room.
9) TUNNEL            Only one person allowed at one time.
10) PRIVATE          Cannot teleport or mist into room.

17) FALL             If fly runs player will fall down to room directly below them.

                     flag works on mobiles as well.
19) HP_REGEN         Gives player an added bonus to HitPoint recovery per tick. This
                     flag works on mobiles as well.
20) SUFFER           Each tick, player will loose 20 mana and 20 vigor.
21) CLAN_ROOM        Other than identify a room as a "Clan Room" this does zilch. Cannot
                     use portal or mist to the room.
22) !RECALL          Player will not be able to recall from room using a scroll,
                     Cleric "Word of Recall" spell will still work in room.
23) FOG              Will not allow player to see mobiles, other players, or
                     objects on the ground.

25) !DISASTER        Stops any disaster flags from working.
26) DISASTER_FIREBA  Every 5 seconds or so a fireball will shoot off and randomly
                     land on some unlucky fellow (chance to miss as well). The
                     target will be knocked to the ground and take 300 hps of damage.
                     The fireball will hit mobs, but they do not take damage, only
                     get knocked to the ground. "Shield" will not reduce dmg taken.
                     Flag will not work in conjuction with the "INDOORS" flag.
27) DISASTER_LIGHTN  Will do check every 5 seconds and have a chance to slam a
                     lightning bolt into a player. Will target mobs, but does not
                     do any damage. (dmg roughly = 300). Flag will not work in
                     conjuction with the "INDOORs" flag.
28) DISASTER_EARTHQ  Currently does nothing.
29) DISASTER_WIND    Currently does nothing.
30) SMALL_RACE       DOES NOT WORK! Intended to only let base races pass through, at
                     present it will not allow any race type to enter.

32) COLD             See &08REDIT_SUFFER&00

REMORT ASCEND

Once you've reached level 50, you have the opportunity to be reborn as
a new, more powerful race.  There is no restriction on which of the 20 races
you can become, but some remort races are harder to play than others...
To be reborn, you will have to seek out an appropriate quest master,
who will ask you to perform some tasks.  You will also have to have
fifty quest points, and have at least 100% experience.

There are nine available new races:
Amara          - a race of highly intelligent amphibious creatures
Demon          - a large, powerful creature of the underworld
Elementals     - a magical race, made from air, earth, fire or water
Faerie         - a small creature, very skilled with magics
Giant          - a race of very large, very strong, and very stupid creatures
Izarti         - an ancient and wise race of feline humanoids
Undead         - a race of creatures that didn't realize death was the end
Vampire        - a creature of the night that feeds on other living beings
Werewolf       - a cross between a wolf and a human; hard to kill

You can also remort into ascended versions of the 11 traditional races:
Ascended Human  
Dark Drow
Dragonspawn
Elf Ancient
Feyborn Gnome
Firstborn Dwarf
Halfling Sneak
Minotaur Warchampion
Ogre Magi
Orc Blooddrinker
Rootfellow Troll

When you are reborn, you will become level 1 again, and forget all the
skills and spells you learned.  Your new attributes will be set based on
your existing attributes, so if you are at max intelligence before
remorting, you will be at max intelligence afterward.

Please note that you can remort from a remort race to a different remort race.
There is no quest point charge for this, but you will have to be at level 50
and have 100% experience.

   Save your persona.  This includes experience points, strength, gold, etc.
Your equipment is also saved in the (unlikely?) event of a crash.  The game

You CANNOT load a saved version if you die -- your persona still exists,
but you will lose experience, and all your objects stay in the game, with
your corpse.

Note that the SAVE command only saves your equipment in the event of a
crash.  If you are leaving the game normally, SAVE will NOT save your
equipment -- you must find an Inn to store your belongings.

SEDIT_OPEN

The times (in MUD-hours) between which the shop is open. Two sets of
Open/Close pairs are allowed so that the shop can be open twice a day (for
example, once in the morning and once at night). There are 28 hours in a
MUD day.
Example:
If you wanted to make your shop keeper start selling equipment from 12:00 to
5:00 in the morning you would set the "open 1" time to 0 and "close 1" time to 5.

SEDIT_PRODUCTS

P) Products Menu

Allows you to add products you wish the shopkeeper to sell. These products
must be in the shopkeepers inventory in order for them to be sold. Objects that
do not have a cost will not be listed for sale. A shopkeeper can have up to
five products for sell.
#51
SEDIT_RATE

Sell Rate
*The price of an object when a shopkeeper sells it is the object's value
 times Profit When Selling. It must be >= 1.0.
Buy Rate
*The amount of money a shopkeeper will offer when buying an object is the
 object's value times Profit When Buying. It must be <= 1.0.

A pawn shop could: Sell at: [2.00], Buy at: [0.50]. Meaning it would sell
items at twice as much as their worth and buy them at half price.

Accumulative: No
Duration    : 5 hours per level
Description :

   This spell will enable you to sense hidden life forms in a room.

SET

set [file|player] <character> <field> <value>

SET is an extremely powerful command, capable of setting dozens of aspects of
characters, both players and mobiles.

SET PLAYER forces set to look for a player and not a mobile; useful for
players with lame names such as 'guard'.

SET FILE lets you change players who are not logged on.  If you use SET FILE
on a player who IS logged on, your change will be lost.  If you wish to set
a player who is in the game but is linkless, use set twice -- once with the
FILE argument, and once without -- to make sure that the change takes.

For toggled fields, the value must be ON, OFF, YES, or NO.

Look at do_set in act.wizard.c for a list of valid set fields.

   A Shadow Dancer's affinity for darkness will allow him to receive
help from that very darkness. Occasionally (slightly more often than

SHADOW-DANCE SHADOWDANCE

Usage       : shadow <victim>
Description :

   This skill can only be used in combat, and only if the room the Shadow
Dancer is in is dark (or the Shadow Dancer is affected by shadow sphere). The
Shadow Dancer manipulates the surrounding darkness, enabling them to vanish
from view briefly... thus giving them the opportunity to backstab their
intended victim. In addition, the Shadow Dancer can use this skill defensively
(this is automatic), thus causing some of their opponents attack to miss as the
Shadow Dancer fades in and out of the shadows.

NOTE: If used to backstab an opponent you are fighting already, the
damage is NOT reduced(unlike circle).

SHADOW-DANCER SHADOWDANCER

   Shadow Dancers are some what akin to Mages and Thieves, yet they are neither.
They are the masters of shadow magic and stealth, having many abilities
which manipulate the darkness around them. Their minds are so tuned to
operating in darkness that shadow dancers experience an increased mana
recovery rate in dark areas.

Usage       : cast 'shadow sphere' [self only]
Accumulative: No
Duration    :
Description :

   This spell causes a globe of magical darkness to surround the Shadow
Dancer, the globe is fairly small, so does not darken the entire room the
Shadow Dancer is in. How ever, this does make the Shadow Dancer impossible
to see, unless the beholder has infravision(lights have no effect on the
magical darkness). In addition, anyone striking at the Shadow Dancer will
be enveloped by the sphere and thus be unable to see unless they have
infravision.

NOTE: from the Shadow Dancers perspective, the area around them is always
dark, thus the Shadow Dancer them self will be unable to see unless they have
infravision. This does, how ever, give the Shadow Dancer the benefit of
increased mana recovery as described in the class description.

To end the spell prematurely, use the visible command.

SHOOT

Usage       : shoot <ammo> <victim> <direction>

more damage per arrow. Damage is also dependent on the type of arrow in use.
Dexterity influences your chances of hitting the target as well as the damage
done. Rangers alone are able to shoot while in combat. Due to the complex
positioning required to shoot an arrow in combat, after firing an arrow rangers
are unable to parry for a short period.

Vendors throughout the world sell a wide variety of arrows with varying damage
and USELEVELs.  Some of the best arrows are found in eq areas.

SHOPS

   Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive the
perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a specific
type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your armor, even if
it is of high quality!

To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a shop by
murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The shopkeepers are
often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading and, indeed, surviving
in a world where the only safe prospect is death in the end.

SHOU SHOU-LIN SHOULIN MONK

   Shou-Lin priests are masters of the maspectial aspects. They really don't
believe in the use of weapons, but needing a form of self defense, they
have learned to use their own body as a lethal weapon in time of trouble.
Due to their lifestyle they are very nimble, but the hardships they must
endure for their soul causes them to be rather small and gangly. Because
of their size they might not last long in a fight, but then again, they
usually end the fight quickly with their superior fighting skills.

50	10d6		-50		9/9

NOTE: The bonus to hitroll and damroll only applies bare handed.

Further to the above, Shou-Lins also get a number of other combat benefits:
i)  Shou-Lins only get -2 to hit and +20 to ac when blinded instead of -4 +40.
ii) A shou-lin can still dodge incoming attacks even while blind.

Against the above, Shou-Lins receive only a modest amount of hps and may not
wear armor, not that they really need it anyway.

SNOOP

Snoop allows you to listen in on another player's session; everything the
player sees or types will be displayed on your terminal preceeded by a '%'.

Obviously, there are many ethical considerations to the use of this command;
snoop should be used minimally, and only for disciplinary purposes.

Type snoop <your name> to stop snooping.

SNOWBALL

Snowball is just a social -- it prints a funny message, and nothing more.

SOCIALS

   Socials are commands used to show your affective state to others.  The

SOLAMNIC-KNIGHT KNIGHT PALADIN

   The Solamnic Knights believe that their honor is their life. Trained in
weapons since the day they were born, the Knights are quite formidable in most
fights. Due to their strong faith in Paladine, the god of Justice, they have
been granted some priestly magic to aid them in battle.

It is said that the Knights are some of the wisest and stubbornest people
around. Once a Knight says he will do something, he'll usually find a way to
do it...no matter how long it takes.

Description :

   This lets a thief "look" at someone without anyone in the room noticing.

STALK

Usage       : stalk <victim>
Description :

   Similar to the follow command, this command if successful will cause you to
start following your victim.  Perhaps, unfortunately for the victim, the

STATUS EXPLORER VETERAN LEGEND

Your Status is an indication of how well you know the realm.  A Status
of None means you may have mastered your class, but you still have
much to learn.  A Status of Explorer means you have travelled around,
seen the sights, killed the innocents.  A Status of Veteran means you
are getting quite experienced, and can comfortably navigate some of
the tighter bends in the MUD.

A Status of &14Legend&00 means you are the fount of knowledge.  You
are widely travelled, and have seen most of the sights the realm has
to offer.  When you reach this Status, you should know the MUD better
than you know your own home.

Your Guildmasters, too, recognise your Status.  When you reach the
Veteran level, you will be able to learn a new skill or spell.  When
you reach Legend status, you will gain access to a second epic skill
or spell.  It is said that a Veteran or a Legend should know enough to
work out how to use these skills and spells without any help ...

Your Status, and the Status of other players, can be seen on the WHO
list.

STEADFASTNESS

Usage       : steadfastness
Description :

   This skill allows a warrior to better protect his or her self.  While
steadfast, the warrior will take reduced damage from physical and magical
sources.  The warrior will have a reduced number of attacks due to the
focus required.

SEE ALSO: Warrior, berserk, invigorate
#0
STEAL

   There is a definite skill to stealing, and only members of the thief class
have this ability. The chance of success depends on:

* The thief's dexterity
* The victims intelligence
* The relative levels of the thief and victim
* What the thief is trying to steal: stealing money is the easiest, stealing
  items from the victims inventory is a little harder, stealing the victims
  equipment is considerably harder(varies according to where the item is worn),
  but, IS possible.
* Particularly powerful creatures are harder to steal from(in this case, if
  the victim is injured, the penalty may be reduced or eliminated).
* Stealing from immortals is impossible(which does include a few monsters,
  but not many).
* If the victim is asleep, the chance of success is increased(but not
  automatic).
* The thief's skill level.

Even if the thief succeeds, there is still a chance the victim will notice
the theft. This chance is related to the victim's intelligence and what the
thief is trying to steal. The victim is highly likely to notice the theft
of something they are wearing, less likely to notice something stolen from
their inventory and will rarely notice gold being stolen (especially if the
thief is highly skilled). IF the victim notices the theft and is a player
(but not a killer or thief), the thief  will gain a THIEF, HUNTED and KILLER
flag. This lasts for several game days, during which time city guards will
attack the thief. There are no other effects apart from showing up in who
(and making you unpopular with your victim :p). Monsters will typically
hunt the thief down until one or the other is dead if they catch a thief
trying to steal from them.

Examples:

> steal gold drunk

> steal crown vrolok
Very hard if Vrolok is wearing the crown!

STOP

Usage      : stop

Also, if you are not tanking, you can use stop to stand down from combat.
Any charmed followers will stop fighting as well.

endurance and stamina. This ability is a prime requisite of warriors
because they must be physically powerful in order to wear armor and wield

TIPS

   These tips are offered by the Older RavenMudders

Rent
****
Several of you have not been renting out when leaving mud, you
have been going link dead. Please use Rent! For those of you that
don't use Rent, someday you will come back or have come back to
find all your equipment missing and will not be able to get it
back. The rent areas are connected within steps of both Midgaard
and Samsera center.
>From Sams ctr - 2n e u
>From Mid ctr - e u

Multi-Linking
*************
Type Policy or read Policy Board.
Multi-linking is very much against policy and the punishment can
and will be severe. Having more than one character on at same
time, even if they aren't helping each other is STILL considered
Multi-linking. Going link dead with one character and playing
other is STILL considered Multi-Linking. Play one character at a
time, when done with that one, RENT it out before bringing on
another.

TIPS1

Donation Room
*************
Everything in donation room is marked !sell, which means shop
keepers will not buy it. Trying to auction donated items is also
frowned upon. Several time the person that donated the item will
become very upset, which could cause you some grief. The best
thing to do is sell only things you have acquired from mobs you
kill.

Spamming
********
Several things can be considered "Spamming". Using ooc, query,
auction, grats or roleplay for anything except what it is for.
&13Query is for questions that you can't find the answer in
help files. NOT for begging.
&05Auction is for selling and buying items. Use some common
courtesy and do NOT make remarks about price or stats. If you
can't afford or don't want to buy, then don't say anything.
&03Roleplay is to be used only as what it says, to Roleplay.
Grats is to grat someone on a level. Please make it short
and sweet. No WOOOOOOOOO HOOOOOOOOO's or !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
&10OOC is the most abused by all, but if you must use, keep in
mind that "begging for help" "USING CAPITALS" and constant
nonsense can be hazardous to your health.

MOTD
****
MOTD = Message of the Day
You know that screen you pass when logging on. Take time to read
it. And if your in a hurry, type motd while your regening. It
changes often and sometimes has very important News in it.

Uptime
******
If you read the MOTD you would know about the new command called
uptime. Instead of asking "when was last reboot" type uptime.

TIPS2

Begging
*******
There is a fine line between Begging and asking.
Once is asking.
Twice, your Begging.
If you ask once and get no reply, don't ask again. Don't spam
channels asking for groups. Use the time and energy to get your
own exp.  Begging is the Biggest cause of low level kills.
Grouping with a large group or high level players is not to be
expected, or taken for granted. High level players are not here to
power level you or get you eq. They worked for their levels, you
should do the same.

Triggers
********
Those of you that have triggers set up to "get all corpse" when
you see R.I.P. should change it.
use these........
You receive * experience points.
You receive your share of experience -- * points.
(replace the * with whatever your client uses)
This will keep you from stealing the gold and eq from someone
else's kill. Which btw is a real fast way of becoming dead.

Save
****
With all the crashes we go through I thought maybe a small
reminder might save you some grief.

SAVE - this little word can do as it says, Save you alot of time,
gold, eq and exp. Alot of times when mud crashes it will erase
anything you did just before crash, so best thing is to "save"
whenever you do anything. Those with mud clients will have it
easy, those that use telnet, put "save" attached to you aliases.
Or just learn to type save all the time. Add it to your tick
timer, or make a macro key for it. Make it a habit and you will be
much happier.

Area Command
************
Typing area often when your exploring can save you one of the
biggest head aches you may ever have. So many time I hear "I died,
but don't know where". With over 30,000 rooms on the mud, this
could be a BIG problem. Type area every now and then, trust me, it
won't hurt.

TIPS3

Recalls
*******
There are hundreds of Free recalls out there. There is NO reason
for anyone to have to ask for a summon. Constantly begging for a
summon is a good way of getting a summon to a very aggro area and
loss of life and equipment. Make it a habit to check inventory
before you go anywhere.

Stats on Equipment
******************
There are players that have spent months gathering the stats on
equipment and filing it. They spent hours on runs, stayed up
nights to log stats after eq runs. Watched and logged auction
channel. Spent their gold on knowing scrolls and stood in shops
for hours buying and iding eq. They worked for and EARNED the
Knowledge they have. Why should YOU expect them to give that
Knowledge away? Work for your own knowledge. Become a mudder, not
a beggar. Buy your own pens and paper, use your own brain, use
your own time and effort.

Suicide
*******
Bringing on a character you no longer use and letting a mob kill
it, then bringing on another character to kill that mob to receive
more exp is called "Suiciding". Doing this will get both
characters "Purged", "Frozen" and if your the unlucky sort, a ban
on your site.

TRIGEDIT_INTENDED

This is either Mobiles (the default), Objects or Rooms. While in most cases it

only use the correct type.

TRIGEDIT_NAME

Always use names that explain the trigger. More importantly: always include the
VNUM for the mob/obj/room the trigger is going to be attached to.

Examples:
   Super Agro    --> trigger attached to mob 1310
   Room rotates  --> trigger attached to room 1300
   No Drop       --> trigger attached to obj 1301
#51
TRIGEDIT_NUM

Dependant on the trigger type, these values will mean different things. For
instance, if you've decided to use a hitprcnt trigger, the numeric Arg is the
percent a mobs hit points have to fall to, before the trigger is activated,
and the command list is executed.
#51
TRIGEDIT_ROOM_RANDOM

No specific event needs to occur for this trigger to be activated. Every 13
seconds this trigger has a chance to run. This trigger is good to add weather,
noise, and other ambience into your zone.

Numeric Arg : 0-100: percentage chance this trigger will run.
Argument    : not used.

   Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player. This

the ability to use magic of any sort.

WEAR

   If you want to wear some clothes, armor or the likes.

Also, to wear everything in your inventory (or at least try to, as wearing
things like loaves of bread is not a good way to win friends and influence
people) you can type "wear all".

Optionally, you can specify what part of your body to wear the equipment on.

> wear boots
> wear all.bronze
> wear all
> wear ring finger

It is to your advantage to have an item equipped in each equipment slot since
nearly all items are to your benefit.

You can hold one light or one item, wear two rings, one cloak, one item around
your neck, one on your body, one on your head, one item on your ears, one on
your face, one on your arms, one on your hands, one on your feet, one on your
legs, one about your body, one as a shield, two items on your wrists, and
wield one item. Some very rare items have also been known to orbit a user's
head.
