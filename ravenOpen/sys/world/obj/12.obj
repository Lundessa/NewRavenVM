You also notice that there is a list of things to do that the

          Aliases which allow you to customize or string together commands;

          Colors which allow you to customize the colors you see
          Type help color
          
          Shorthand which allows you to use partial commands to save
          keystrokes.

          Scribe which allows mages to actually create magical scrolls 
          Type help scribe
 
&25&00          A nice website wehre you can learn alot more about
&25&00          Raven and mudding in general.  Type Help Web to see the
          URL's.

         We also have an amusing little selection of socials for having
         some fun. Type socials for a list but try not to overdo it when
         you use them. Remember spamming is a crime

chapter3~
Chapter 3
          Type policy and also read the policy board located down
          from the board in the Adventurers Guild. Pkilling and stealing
          is LEGAL here on Raven, but you sure won't make any friends.
          If you flout society, however, there are penalties. Type 
          help killer and help hunted for details. Learn who you can trust
          and group together for mutual protection.
         
          Etiquette on the mud is important. Try not to repeatedly
          ask the same thing over and over. Do not be offended if
          no one answers your question. Do not leave town and not
          take notes on where you went so that you can backtrack.
          People are not impressed by players who repeatedly get
          lost and beg for assistance. Make a name for your self as
          someone who shows common sense. Never follow someone unless
          invited. Above all show good manners.
~
E
chapter2~
Chapter 2
          Read the help files on any topic you have a question on BEFORE
          you ask a player or IMM. To do so simply type help topic-name.
          Type commands to see what commands are available, type help
          areas to see what places you can go, paying strict attent-
          ion to the level recommendations.
  
          You're here to have fun by matching your wits and skills
          against the game. By reading carefully, exploring, and
          using common sense, you will succeed in besting the nasty
          creatures and thereby gain experience points, money, and
          equipment. Raven is a world that rewards the quick-witted
          and curious at heart. Remember it's a cold cruel world
          out there and only the strong or nimble survive, but Raven
          helps those who help themselves. 

          Raven also rewards those who group together combining their
          individual skills to make a group whose sum is greater than
          its parts. For example a typical group might consist of a
          'tank' or lead hitter usually a warrior or other fighter class;
          a cleric to heal, a thief to pick locks, and a mage to provide a
          variety of spells. By teamwork a group can can more experience,
          go more places to explore, and gain more equipment, than a solo
          player.

chapter1~
Chapter 1
          Type wear all and type wield sword to use the equipment
          you have been given to start. If you leave town always
          type hold torch to use your light. You have a water
          container to drink from or use the fountain at center.
         
          You will need food which you can buy at one of the stores
          in town. Other supplies like armor, weapons, magic potions
          and scrolls are also available at various stores which
          may also buy things from you.

          To save your progress, type save. To save any supplies and
&25&00          equipment you must rent at an Inn.  The nearest one is east, up
&25&00          from the fountain.  When you see the receptionist type offer and
          you will be told how much rent-per-day is based on what you have.
          To rent simply type rent if you have enough money.

&25&00          Locate the Adveturers Guild and the Donation rooms north-
&25&00          west and north-east of the fountain. Read the map and the 
          boards and use the equipment you might find in the donate
          room.

          The official newbie area to start killing mobs for experi-
          ence is the Chessboard located 2 south and all west of
&25&00          center. The Adventurers guild map room also contains sug-
          gestions on places to go.

       ** Heres a hint btw when contemplating attacking a mob type
          con mobname. If the resulting message indicates a great
          likely hood of dying, then you probably will.

the slightest sound.  Its black fur seems almost real, and it looks ready to
pounce on any intruder.  The jackals long dark tail drapes down the back of a
golden pedestal covered in fine intricate hieroglyphs no human hand could
shape.  The jackal wears a collar of the finest gold, carved in an intricate
pattern that at once draws the eye and repels it.

The mob flags SEEKR and MEMORY now mean what their names suggest - eg, if a
mob is flagged SEEKR, it will TRACK when hit, if a mob is flagged MEMORY is
will hit the player that attacked it when it next sees them.  Note that a mob
flagged both will NOT track.

This does not affect existing mobs behaviourally - eg, if they were flagged
SEEKR before, they are now flagged MEMORY, leaving them with the same
behaviour.
