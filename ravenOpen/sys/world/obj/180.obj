&12The Underdark rising?&00
Latest rumor through the Elven community is that the Mages of the 
Underdark prepare to overthrow the Tower of High Sorcery! As to when
this may take place or who could be behind such a scheme is unknown to
the writers at the Oracle. The messenger who provided us with this
information has mysteriously dissapeared.

&04An Island of Mist?!&00
   A number of unaccounted reports to the Oracle have exclaimed the
existence of a hidden Island somewhere to the southwest of Samsera!
The Oracle has sent out a number of scouts to see if this is true, but
all have been unable to find nothing except a swamp of mist. Please
inform the Oracle if such a place does exist!

&01Dangerous and Shady Characters&00
  A public safety announcement from Marek, associate of the Oracle.

Beware of the characters Jakee and Venge, these players ask to group with 
you or start following you. As soon as you are wounded, they have been 
known to turn on you and kill you for your equipment.
I know this from experience and wish to save others from the rage and 
irritation it caused. Take care when you are wounded.

&02An Interview with the Ranger Adventurer Langou.&00
===============================================
You say, 'Greetings Langou'

You bow before her.

Langou giggles.

Langou bows before you.

Langou says, 'good day to you as well!'

Langou sits down and rests.

Langou stops resting, and clambers on her feet.

Langou smirks.

Langou sits down and rests.

Langou fidgits a bit.

You say, ' You have become known in our realms as a proficient wanderer 
and adventurer, and I thought our readers may like to know more about you.'

Langou chuckles politely.

You say, ' Tell me, what philosophy does one such as you live by?'

Langou sinks deeply into her own thoughts.

Langou says, 'i feel that balance is important. Honor is good, but not to
the point where you are inflexible.'

You nod solemnly.

You say, 'so how do you feel about good and evil?'

Langou says, ' it is good to help others, but one should not sacrifice 
ones self to do it. And you should always try and improve yourself and 
your status, but not destroy your karma to achieve your goals.

You say. ' I see, so would you consider yourself 'good'?'

Langou says, 'and above all, rescpect gaea, the mother.'

Langou says, 'nooo...although I think others might.'

Langou says, 'i don't consider sentient life any more valuable than any 
other life....and a boring life is worthless.'

You nod solemnly.

A flock of vultures swoop down from the sky to devour the corpse of Langou.

Langou smiles happily.

You shake your fist at the Carrion.

Langou points up at the vultures.

Langou says, 'Part of the circle...I die, they feed.'

Langou says, 'later, they'll die and I'll feed.'

Langou grins evilly.

You say, 'While exploring this realm, have you had any interesting 
encounters you would like to recount to our readers?'

Langou says, 'there are two things which thrill me the most:'

Langou says, 'one is a truly good fight..where you are barely standing, 
moving from room to room, throwing every last ounce of strength at your 
opponent. And when you finally stagger back into your guild to recover,
there is more blood on you than in you.'

Langou says, 'the second thrill is when i am walking through an area and i 
find a door or tunnel or deer trail that i had never seen before.'

Langou chuckles politely.

Langou says, 'i have had that thrill may times over now, but they begin to 
blur....and i have given that thrill to those i fought as well.'

You say, 'ahhh'

Langou says, 'a while back, i was exploring the High Tower of Sorcery,west
of Samsera'.

You nod solemnly.

You say, 'It is a place of great magics.'

Langou says, 'i and another had followed a master summoner deep into his 
chambers where he has a powerful spell holding...a portal to many places
in the world.'

Langou says, 'after cleaning the blood off my staff, i looked out through
the facets of the portal and saw some places I recognized..and some I did
not.'

Langou smiles happily.

Langou says, 'we chose to enter a place we did not recognize.'

You say, 'intriguing.'

Langou says, 'after walking a bit in windy tunnels deep underground i 
believe..i scanned as far as I could see and noticed a dark glow 
eminating from around a corner...'

Brrrrrrr.

Langou says, 'looking closer, we saw a red dragon!'

Langou says, 'I shall not go into specifics..but know that I bruised its
teeth with my armor many a time. To this day I still owe that beast a
death!'

You chuckle politely.

You say, 'Do you have any final words of heed for our readers?'

Langou says, 'Exploration gains knowledge....and knowledge gains power.'

Langou says, 'There are names twe shall never forget..though they are gone
now...we always shall remember those who shine.'

Langou howls.

You say, 'Thank you for your time and knowledge.'

Langou bows deeply.

Deaths from across the realm of Raven as reported by friends and 
confidantes of the temporarily deceased.

&10Dwarven adventurer slain&00
   Condolences to the Dwarven community who lost their brother Blackpope
for a short time. During his fierce attempt to kill a cat, the dwarf was
killed by a Samsera Guardsman, who assisted the kitty and quickly
rescued it.

&01We don't need no steekin' badgers!&00
   Exploring in the wild alone can be dangerous. The adventurer Calis
found this out the hard way as he was killed by a rabid badger at
the Muddy Tree in the forest east of Samsera.

&06Suicide?&00
   A report of this bizarre death came to the Oracle's attention one
month ago. While battling the Shire's Thain, the adventurer known as
Drez recited a powerful fireball scroll....upon himself.
This instantly turned the adventurer into a pile of ash, which is said
to be fertilizing the Thain's office gardens to this day.
Drez, the writers at the Oracle salute you!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Greetings,
   The days and nights have been good to us all, and your wonderful
adventurings throughout our great and diverse world have given us the
information to prepare another issue for you. Much has occured since
our last issue, much indeed. Our knowledge of Raven has grown immensely,
as reports of new and exciting places have flooded our offices. Magic
is strong..perhaps at its strongest, as those who wear the robes of the
mage walk openly about the streets of our fair towns, no longer afraid
of the stonings that townsfolk once gave them. It is rumored that a new
Tower of High Sorcery will appear in Palanthas sometime soon.
   These things are indeed wonderful. But I lower myself now by speaking
out upon certain adventurers who have alienated themselves from our
civilization by their cruel words and actions. You all know who I speak
of, but I shall not utter his name, for it would stink upon my lips like
the feces of sheep.  I am ashamed to say that this being is an elf,
(albeit an outcast of our race) ..and that he darkens our glory by
sharing our blood. This young fool has set himself upon a pedestal, deeming
himself more important than the gods themselves. Such arrogance and utter
pettiness has led to his own death, a long time coming. It is the hope of
this editor and his staff that the outcast be put to the sword and spell
every time he dares show his twisted face in our city of Samsera. But it
is realized that this is not easy, as many innocents have been harmed in 
the past. We must be vigilant and determined to convince this cowardly,
pathetic outcast that he is no longer welcome in our world. Indeed if I
had my old dagger back, I would lend any elf (or man) a hand.
   Upon this note I bid you all the luck of the Gods.
   May your lives continue to be prosperous and exciting.

   Rhyvis, Editor in Chief

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

&01Peculiar Tracks!&00
   A large mold of a animal track was sent to our offices this week past.
Upon examination of the track it has been determined that it was made by a
massive sauropod some fifty feet in height. The track was taken by a local
adventurer off the shores of a strange ocean, off the forgotten forest (?).
Since such a beast would be so dangerous, the &11Oracle&00 offers a free
decade long subscription to the provider of any further information.

&02 A Strange Land&00
   As many of you may know, the sea off Samsera's eastern desert is home
portals here long ago, but it is suspected that it is a secret held by the
order of mages. Upon a recent expedition to Palanthas, i experienced a 
most unpleasant journey to a new land after entering the portal I *once*
thought was to Palanthas (Editor's note: This was my vacation). This
strange place was obviously once a beautiful forest..but has somehow been tainted
by a darkness looming over the land. I did not stay long, but this area
should be explored and reported to the Samserian authorities and travel
association.

&04Sail the Seas&00
   Ahoy! It seems that sometimes things can appear out of nowhere. Such is
strange nature of our world. It is now confirmed that a massive ocean which
lies off of Samsera's (black market) docks. This body of water appears to
be three times the size of the Emerald Sea. Our initial scouting reports
have yielded the following: Solamnia, home of Palanthas is located off the
Ocean's eastern borders. A large town, rivalling Samsera's in size has
been spotted. It appears that this City's name is 'Freeport'. A large
creature has been sighted near the centre of the Ocean. No two reports have
been the same regarding the appearance of the creature, but four ships
have been lost in that vicinity. Please sail with caution.

&02War Camp&00
   There have been rumors of a new War Camp somewhere about Samsera. At
this time we know nothing of this rumor. Any additional information will
be distributed to you, the reader, as soon as possible.

&09Purple Dinosaur&00
   We have received multiple reports of a small purple dinosaur travelling
the streets of Samsera molesting its citizens. One report is that such a 
creature followed the Ranger known as Sorrow for an hour, repeatedly
hugging and singing to him.
The Samserian authorities have been notified of this abomination and a
warrant for its arrest has been issued.

Thomas says, 'well yes there have been a few like the time i travelled with a large
              party to camelot to battle the mighty King Arthur'

It seems that mages have been the hot topic this year, topping the
'popularity' polls at the Oracle. In fact, they grace our obituary 
pages, being the most popular choice for the afterlife as well.

&04Yum..Magecakes and Syrup&00
    It doesn't pay to play with Giants. Ask Calideon. His assault on a
very angry Fomorian giant led to his own squishing. He has since become
unflattened and frequents the area less.

&02 Do not drink and cast!&00
   Morgana came to a quick and unfortunate demise early this year. Injured
from a recent battle, she quaffed a potion, thinking it would restore
her health. However, this particular potion was not of that variety and
quickly sent her to a gurgling, intoxicated death.

&01Do not feed the animals.&00
   The prehistoric area of our world is quite dangerous, with its lethal
plants and animals. The poor soul known as Khelban, known to explore the
area had a mishap with the great Tyrannosaurus Rex, becoming his lunch not
once, not twice, but three times. Having overeatten, the monstrous Rex
lumbered off, allowing Khelban to recover his chewed possessions.

&03Death of the Week&00
   Of course this column would not be complete with mention of the death
of the notorious outcast Thyris! This rascal came full circle and met his
doom once again. He is now despised my many of this world's adventurer's,
who shall likely bring it about again and again. Heres to more great 
moments!

&08Seek and Ye Shall Find&00
   It is said that curiosity killed the cat, but it obviously killed the
Shadowdancer as well. The cleric Newbee met his death upon entering the
flaming trap of a burning house. Newbee's companion Nox, who is
often quick on his toes, rushed into the burning house, in search of
poor Newbee's ghost. But alas...all he found was his own death. The
new owners of the house say that they hear the screams of the adventurer's
ghosts nightly.

The Oracle's favorite quote was made by Zaor:

"&13I see dead ppl&00"

Hmmmm...

editorial~
                            ===&11EDITORIAL&00===

I remember when... I think I have heard this comment out of the lips
of everyone in the lands of Raven at least once.

I remember when I spat in the face of King Xerxes and won...
I remember when I had the best armor, weapons, jewelry...
I remember when I had 100 million gold coins in the bank...
I remember when I shared an elaborate house with my brethren...
I remember how good I was...

Of course, I don't remember being a newling, needing help and having
questions.

With the recent End of Days, when the trumpet rang out that the world
as we knew it was coming to an end, we were all transformed into those
newlings. An adventurer who has to kill rabbits for food, dies to
Blue Jays and dogs and squirrels. An adventurer whose clothing bursts
into flames when they touch the ground. An adventurer with no money to
his or her name, searching to learn all over again. An adventurer mapping
out a new continent, finding new places to conquer and new ways to Die.

While in past lives we may have all been a legend in our own eyes, when
that trumpet blew, we all became the same newlings. Some of us may have
retained more knowledge, some of us had more past lives and experiences
that seem to carry with us no matter how many times we are born again.
But we are all Brethren.

My message in this issue is short, but I hope poignant...

We were all born into this world with nothing. We will all leave this
world with that which we entered. We were all newlings once, not
skilled in the ways of battle, healing, crafts, comradery! Keep that in
mind when someone asks you a question you think is stupid.

rumors lore~
                          ===&10RUMORS AND LORE&00===

&10The Bone Collector&00
It has been rumored that The &02Green&00 Dragon has begun a rather
elaborate collection of mortal bones and remains. When he isn't sleeping
the day away, he is said to be admiring the skull of Willowind or
freeing mortal remains from his teeth with Zerik's femoral bone.

Interestingly enough, he has his remains separated into two piles, the
first is reportedly for his breakfast and lunch and comprised of
the everyday variety, not so difficult to kill creatures. The second,
however, is a treasured pile of Samsera native, Zaor meat. While the
pile grows on a daily and sometimes hourly basis, The &02Green&00 Dragon
is very careful to ration his consumption. Nearby acquaintances say
he is afraid that Zaor will stop visiting him and he will have to settle
for Scar.

&10Tales from the Swamp&00
The Mother Anaconda has sent a request to The Oracle, in hopes that the
slimey perpetrator can be handled outside the swamps. She has noted
that a mortal by the name of &10Fallen&00 has been luring unsuspecting
adventurers to her private chambers so that she may do his dirty work.

As she has reported, this mortal comes to her chambers and gives himself
freely up to death. He then begs for assistance from other adventurers
to help him retreive his belongings. The alleged plot is to get the
Mother to attack and kill his prey so he may then steal their belongings.
When questioned about these less than honorable tactics, Fallen had this
to say:

Fallen says, '--(^)(  because i want his eq )(^)--'
Fallen says, '--(^)(  he can come find me if he wants it back )(^)--'

The Mother Anaconda and The Oracle have their own request:
Find the mortal they call Fallen and punish him so that he may never
betray the trust of your fellow comrades.

The Mother Anaconda takes great pride in killing those who challenge
her life. Do not waste her time with suicide runs and mercy killings.
If you come to visit her, do it for the experience of battle with a
worthy opponent!

&01A Royal Welcome&00
While adventuring, Samserians - Morifray, Grimlock and Crullen stumbled
into the throne room of the King of Hobgoblins. The sight of this over-
musculared King, however, sent a slight panic through Morifray, who
consequently tripped on the King's robe and fell forward into the King's
lap. The Elite Bodyguards standing nearby perceived this as an
assassination attmept and killed poor Morifray before Crullen was able
to rescue him.

&01Don't Judge a Bandit by his Odor&00
Casually wandering through the dark caverns of the Three of Swords,
Element and Druahl picked up the familiar scent of blood in the air.
Eager to wield their weapons against a worthy opponent, they tracked the
smell. As they turned the corner into a blanket of darkness, their
senses were accosted by the presence of a Bandit who apparently had not
bathed in years! The stench was so horrifying in fact, that the two
adventurers began insulting the Bandit relentlessly. Having been
trapped in the caverns his entire life, the Bandit explained he had
little to be proud of. In fact he had only one prized possession
that received all of his attentions and care. From under the his ragged
coat he removed a bright, polished scimitar. The smell of fresh blood
was the last thing these two recall.

&01How Much is Your Life Worth?&00
During a recent trip to the Ivory Tower, Midgaard native Camigwen decided
to try her hand at battle. Although her opponent was good, she did
finally prevail, but not without sustaining serious injury. As Camigwen
lay on the marble bleeding profusely, a pair of Medics walked in and
offered their services. When asked how much she could pay, Camigwen, who
had been saving up for a new suit of armor, offered 5 coins. The Medics
looked at each other, nodded and took the five coins. Camigwen woke up
in the Morgue, unable to remember what had happened.

&13The Playing Field&00
-----------------

&02The Staging Area&00

&05Black Team Side&00--SA--&03Gold Team Side&00    SC = Center of Samsera
                 |                     QGB = Quest for Glory Board Room

                 |
     SC-----------

The QUEST FOR GLORY (QGB) board room is located 8e,n from the Center of Samsera.
This is the room where all flag game participants meet and become organized
for the coming battle.

The STAGING AREA (SA) is the room that the flag field is entered from. 
Travelling to the east will place you at the steps of the Gold Fortress,
travelling to the west will place you at the steps of the Black Fortress. It is
important to look at this room's description before moving, and note where you
are going. This room is PEACEFUL, and is NEUTRAL. No combat is allowed in this
room at any time as opposing team players will often be in it simultaneously.

      P - Portcullis     1 - Black Fortress Steps     2 - Gold Fortress Steps
                 BJ - Black Team Jail     GJ - Gold Team Jail

Portcullis - The portcullis is a gate which separates the two sides of the 
             playing field into identical halves. This gate is kept up for the
             first 5-15 minutes of a flag game, making the other side of the
             field accessible only by successfully traversing the geyser field.
             After that time, it is lowered..opening a direct path to either
             side of the battlefield.

Fortress Steps - 1 is the room you enter if you travel west from the staging 
                 area. 2 is the room you enter if you travel east from the
                 staging area.

Jails - Each team has its own jail. These jails can be locked, and only opened
        /unlocked by someone with the key on the outside. Whenever you die, you
        are sent to your own jail with 0POWER/0MANA/0VIGOR. Note that you do NOT
        lose your eq, it remains on your body. There are NO corpses in flag games.
        Each Jail is PEACEFUL and REGENerates you, so it is a good place for your
        team to recoup and regather. Since you can be locked in a jail and have no 
        way out at times, upon your death you receive a JAILED flag. When this 
        flag runs, you are automatically transported outside the jail, fully
        restored. Outside the jails are rooms that are FOGged, making it impossible
        to see other players in the room. Be careful out there, for it is a
        favorite hunting ground of enemy assassins.

&04How to Win.&00
-----------


 To paraphrase: You must defeat your enemies by killing them or somehow removing them
                from the playing field, giving you the chance to steal their flag from 
                under their noses. When you have gotten their flag, you must take it 
                back to your own fortress and drop it in your TROPHY DISPLAY AREA for 
                a set amount of time (specified by the Immortal Questmaster). If the
                flag is displayed for this amount of time, You Win!


 Deaths: Soo, what do I put at stake for this? The Flag game field is specialized in 
         that a death within its grounds will cost you only 30% the xp loss of a 
         normal death. So, while it is not for the weak of heart, it is not as bad as
         being slaughtered by mobs.


 Death Affect: When you are slain in the flag field, you are automatically sent to 
               your TEAM JAIL with 1 HP, 1MA, and 1MV. Note, you DO NOT LOSE YOUR EQ.
               This jail is where you can recuperate and regroup. (See more on this in
               'The Playing Field') Generally, the team that spends the most time IN 
               the battlefield has the upper hand.

&06What is a Flag Game?&00
-------------------

   A Flag Game is a special type of quest unique to Raven. It consists
of two teams of players squaring off against one another on a specialized
battle field in attempt to capture the other team's flag and win the
game.

 To break this down:
-At the onset of a game, two teams (&03Gold&00 and &05Black&00) are chosen.

-Each team takes their own side of the flag game playing field.

-There are two sides to the playing field; one for &03gold&00, one for &05black&00. 
 Each side contains: The Team Fortress, the Team Jail, and a large 
 fighting area which contains many Death Traps.

-There are two FLAGS, or STANDARDS; one for &03gold&00, one for &05black&00. At the
 start of each game, the standards are displayed at the top of each
castle (In the parapets- theses are reached by traversing a maze and
 a series of death traps).

-Each player begins the game with one key, this key enables them to unlock/lock the
 doors of their own fortress and jail, keeping players out..or in.

-The ultimate goal..kill your opponents, gain access to their fortress, steal their
 standard, and take it to your own castle to display for all to see!

&11Picking Teams&00
------------

While level and power are important factors when picking teams; balance, 
diversity, and a high degree of teamwork and communication are make make winners.
From what has been shown, players with experience and a lack of ego are the most 
successful.

Picking teams are done in one of two ways: 1.) Two captains volunteer or are 
designated; each captain picks a number in between 1 and 10; the winner gets to
choose whether they want first pick, or second and third pick; teams are picked
until no players remain. 2.) The presiding immortal selects the teams in as fair
a manner as they possible can. The Immortal Questmaster reserves the right to remove
or add players from a team during the course of a game to ensure a fair atmosphere.
They are not Obligated to do this, however.

&02Class Balance - Each Class has its positive and negative qualities in a flag field.&00
Ranger - The Ranger's high AC and summonable animals make the class a valued one
         as a tank for teams. As well, its tracking abilities can save a game if a
         specific target is being chased and cuts down on valuable time.

Warrior - The Warrior's brute damage and high constitution make it the ideal class
          for tanking within a group. The Class's rescue and guarding abilities make
          it an excellent damage buffer and offers good protection to lower hit point
          members of the group. However, Warriors are extremely susceptible to spells.

Knight - The Knight as well has high hit points, and a lower armor class than the
         warrior. Combine this with its moderate healing ability, minor sense and
         cure spells, it makes not just a great tank, but a good choice for group
         leader. This is due to its enhanced ability to keep itself alive.

Death Knight - This class works well as a tank, but even better doing damage from 
               the side. Its plague and poisoning abilities can seriously incapacitate
               and slow down opponents. As well, it has a useful plethora of damage
               spells and a relatively useful mob. Its PFG allows it to move about
               in a solo capacity for a time.

Shou Lin - The Shou Lin does not work as effective tank as the previous classes 
           due to its lower hp and armor class, but might be the deadliest class
           on the battlefield. It boasts a large damroll and incapacitating strikes
           such as KO that can swiftly render weaker opponents useless in battle in 
           no time. The Shou lin as well has minor healing abilities which enable it
           to take a considerable amount of solo damage and get away to reheal itself.


Assassin - The scourge of the Flag Game. Its Assassination and stealth tactics lead
           this class to consistently be one of the highest on the kill tallies list.
           Assassins are generally quick on their feet, and score kills on solo 
           targets they catch unaware. A common team tactic is to allow their rogues
           out of their fortress while defending a displayed standard. The Rogues 
           score quick, easy kills and keep the opponent weak enough to stall a 
           massive assault.

Thieves - Thieves ability to move quietly, as well as their feigning ability, have 
          made them the most successful class in capturing and reclaiming standards.
          As well, Thieves are allowed to Steal anything from anyone in the Flag game
          Field (They must return the item at the end of the game). Since there is no
          relooting, a good thief could theoretically steal powerful items off 
          opponents, hampering their performance. It also gives them another option 
          for obtaining flag items.

&11Picking Teams - Classes Continued&00
---------------------------------

Shadow Dancers - Cloaked in constant darkness, the ability to rebackstab, and their
                 sense and stealth skills make this class one of the best for recon. 
                 It moves unseen quite well and is effective at scoping out enemy 
                 groups without their knowing. It is also quite adept at scoring 
                 quick kills on weakened opponents.

Clerics - Likely the Backbone of a Flag Game team. A good Cleric can keep his whole
          team healthy, and decrease wear and tear by enemy strike attacks. They 
          have exceptional defensive abilities and should be savored. This class 
          is often a primary target of rogues, so protect it well with your 
          fighters..you'll live longer.

Mages - This class has the reputation of being the most multi faceted in the flag
        game in that it is able to perform many functions important to the group. 
        Though not a tanking class, it can provide a powerful mob to tank for them.
        Its high damage spells result in it always having high kill scores, and its
        portal spell is useful to move about the flag field via placed points. As 
        well, the summon spell has been known to catch opponents unaware.

&12Rules&00
-----

 Flag Keys and Standards are referred to as Flag-Items. Flag Items carry with 
them a set of rules that must be followed:

1) Flag Items can never be junked, destroyed, sold, or donated.
2) Flag Items can never be kept in a container.
3) Flag Items can never be kept on a mob
4) Battle Standards can never be taken in a peace room (jails).
5) Battle Standards can never be taken from the Flag Battlefield.

Upon your death, Flag Items are dropped from your body where you died. They do
not come with you to jail. Upon losing flag items from a DT Death, the Immortal
Questmaster will take the items and scatter them along the main road (likely in the fog).

Keys - Keys will decay over time, when your key does decay (ie. A plain gold 
       key begins to glow), Quest Say (qs): 'Gold/Black Key has decayed!'. 
       The Immortal will quickly reimburse your key. Try and keep at least one
       key of each color for your team!

Flags - Taking a flag out of the playing area (rule violation 5), into a peace
       room (violation 4), or losing the flag from a Death Trap will result in
       the Immortal to replace it on its original Parapet (Gold Battle Standard
       to Gold Fortress parapet). If the Immortal judges that the violation was 
       more flagrant, they may place it else where.

Mobs - Some games summonable mobs are not permitted for the sake of team balance.
       This is solely up to the discretion of the refereeing Immortal. Mobs are
       not permitted to hold any flag items or eq of any kind. Mobs are permitted
       to be used as portal points.  

Recalls - Players are NOT permitted to use the word of recall spell 
or any such magic items on opposing team players. A Cleric
can recall themselves or any member/s of their own team. In
regards to recall scrolls, They can only be used to recall
one' self, not other teammates. 

Time Limits - A flag game usually runs about an hour, but has been seen to go 
              considerably greater and less durations. General Limits are 
              as follows:
              Opening Preparation and Strategy Time (0 combat) - 5 Minutes
              Time until Portcullis Lowers - 5-15 Minutes.
              Flag Display Time - 5-20 Minutes.
              There are two types of Flag Display Time; Reset and Cumulative.

      Reset: A team must display the flag for the set amount of time
                     undisturbed. If the flag is taken off display during that
                     time, the clock will be reset upon redisplaying the flag.

      Cumulative: A team must display the flag for a set amount of 
                          time only once. As a flag is taken off display, the 
                          clock is merely stopped, only to be started at the 
                          same point upon redisplay.

Player Killing - As soon as the Immortal declares the game is over, all 
                 Killing is to be stopped. Childish acts of killing after the
                 game are not appreciated and will be dealt with harshly (ie: 
                 Being sent to Demogorgon). There is to be no killing other
                 flag game participants OUTSIDE the playing field while the 
                 game is in progress.

Miscellaneous - Players are NOT to accept help from outside players during 
                the course of a flag game.
              - Players are permitted to use any potions they wish unless the
                Immortal running the game restricts use of any.
              - Racist comments, profane language, or any other immature
                behaviour is not permitted during a flag game (Or any other
                time for that matter).
              - Players will respect and heed the judgement of the Immortal
                presiding at all times.

&24Additional and Rewards&00
----------------------

Additions - There are times where certain parameters of the game may be 
            changed by the Immortal Questmaster to provide a different game
            feel. The following are examples of what you may see:
 -Addition of Battle Standard Guardians.
  -Addition of Questing Wands with special effects (see recalls).
-Allowance/Disallowance of the Samserian Healer.
-Restriction of all extraneous potions and magical aids.
-Multiple Battle Standards to capture.
-Victory upon reaching a target amount of kills for your team.
-Four Teams instead of two.

Rewards - The actual reward given to flag game questors is ultimately decided
          by the Immortal running the game. But the following is a general 
          guideline of past and possible future rewards.

Losing Team - 1 Quest Point (for participation)
Winning Team - 2 Quest Points
Runner Up - 4 Quest Points
MVP - 6 Quest Points

MVPS and Runner ups are decided by the Immortal presiding.
                Not all games will have MVPs and runner ups. These positions 
                are usually decided by: teamwork, attitude, roleplaying,
                leadership, kill total, impact on win or loss, and new and 
                imaginative tactics.

As well, minor potions may be rewarded. Another possible 
                reward for MVPS and runner ups may be a temporary boost in
                DAM and HITrolls, practices, or a stat change.

All rewards are subject to change and can be withheld by 
                the immortal if they deem it so.

                              OLD NEW NEWS
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- AUTOLOOT
Disabled due to bug (will not be returning0
  
- EQ Refreash
All eq in rentfiles has been updated to the current stats in the
object files.
This is to let you know we did a one-time eq stats refresh. There
are a variety of reasons this is desperately needed and it will probably 
sting a little.
Please be assured it IS needed and be advised that the result will be ALL eq
will change to match current stats. This is a good news bad news deal. 
Some of you will benefit and some will take a hit. But 'old' eq will be 
updated no matter where it's stored. One casulty will be a hit to forged and 
enchanted items. We agonized over this a while but all the IMM's agreed it's 
a one-time price that has to be paid.
  
- New EQ Slots
When the new slots were imped we had not yet finished deciding on stats limits
yes or no or what they might be.  We have now finished setting them and yes
there are limits on hitroll damroll hp and mana as well as no ac for any new
slot eq The objs have been updated except for those that are currently worn and
those will be changed as well.  These limits will be reviewed in 3 months with
an eye towards boosting them but I urge everyone to take a deep breath before
screaming..  These are new slots...  U are getting bonuses u could not have
before and thus any stat on this eq is a plus no matter what it is or what
limits we set.  During the process of revising stats i have lowered some..  I
have also upped some stats on a number of new slot items in ways to compensate.
In addition the removal of ac means i was able to make a lot of these items
wearable by Sl's So there are some positives in these changes.  I also found
that the conversion process may have icked an item or two that should have
stayed in the old slot and i have fixed that as well Lastly if there is an item
formerly ofvery high stats that is in a new slot and u can make a case for it
going back to old slot please mudmail Corwin
  
- Forge
A dwarven traveller stumbled into my office today, with a message for
you all.  They seem to be instructions of some sort on improving weapons.
Unfortunately, a fire imp got loose in my office and burned most of the
notes on how it works.  All I have left of the message is something about
'forge'  and "...n des..oy t.e o..ect quite easily so b. c.reful."
I appologize for the someone cryptic message, perhaps you guys can figure
it out.
  
- Earrings
an imm pointed out a slight imbalance with earrings and damroll so at least 2
have had dam added or upped and a new earring is in game as well worn by a mob
that likes to tap you on the shoulder

Justarius says, 'How many guards were lost?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Seventeen.'
Justarius says, 'How did they rout your men so well?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'They carried great battle treasures
bestowed with powerful enchants.  And they had daggers, lots of em.'
Justarius says, 'Then what happened?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'From what I collected from the heros and
heroines, Netheragi made a strat path to my quarters.  Veneziruion died
in a struggle with Netheragi, or so I was told.  They then took me prisoner. 
When the guards started puring into the entrance to the dungeons they told
the Dungeon Operator what was going on.'
Justarius says, 'Netheragi was a powerful minotaur in all aspects.  What
did the operator do?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'He pled with the people of our land for
heros and heroines to save the dungeons from the full scale riot.  A
band of such heros formed and gathered at the Entrance.'
Justarius says, 'Then what happened?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Then they began to kick butt.  The group
of heroines and heros tore through the prisoners, the rogues and sneaks
with methodical precision.  They stumbled a tad when one of their band,
a rogue thing, attacked the monk of amal that counsels the prisoners.
A couple heros fell during the descent into the bowels of Denegorth.'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Several of the prisoners were out
prowling the corridors looking for trouble, and they found it.  The
hero's sent them on their way to the netherworld with ease.  When the
heroes and heroines made their way to the dungeon's commons, a
particularly short rogue in their band fell to several minotaur guards
that were barring passage.  The brave group did make it past them and
slaughtered Lord Ruerphux just before they met up with the warlock and
the warlord.
Justarius says, 'That sounds like a challenging battle.'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Indeed.  I was told that the heroes
hesitated for a while at this fight.  Eventually they pressed on and
engaged Routhex and Netheragi in battle...'
Justarius says, 'What was the outcome?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'From my soundproof cell I heard the
death cries of several heros.  It must of been a truely gruesome
battle.  I was told that as many as 6 heros died in that first
encounter.'
Justarius says, 'I truely fear that Hiddukel is with Netheragi in
spirit.'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'I did as well.  I am told that after
recovering that the band of heros and heorines did slay both Netheragi
and Routhex.  I felt the dungeons shake when Netheragi was slain.
while after that my cell door was opened and I greeted the heros and
heroines groggily.  They told me the outcome of things.  With great joy
I granted them a special gift of my own.  I also hear that the Mayor of
Samsera rewarded these courageous citizens with rewards as well.'
Justarius says, 'I hope your dungeons have recovered?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Yes they have.  I'd like to add that if
anyone wishes to see the outcome of overly offensive behavior to come
visit me and my guards.  We have a cell prepared for you'
Justarius says, 'Thank you for your time Warden.'

Interview with the Warden of Denegorth -
by Justarius
  
Justarius says, 'Good morning Warden.'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Good morning to you Grandmaster
Justarius.'
Justarius says, 'There recently was a disturbance in your dungeons and
I wanted to put here the complete story of what happened for everyone's
knowledge and benefit.'
The Warden of Denegorth nods.
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'It all started about a week ago.  I was
at my desk reviewing my prisoner manifesto when I heard the door to my
private chamber being bashed open.'
Justarius nods.
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'That was followed by a blinding flash of
light and then total darkness.  I was stricken blind.  I heard
Veneziruion cry out, and I heard a deep voice scream in agony.'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'It was then that the dark assassin
imprisoned in the Dungeons of Denegorth bested me with the aid of
Routhex.  I was dragged out of my chambers and through the dungeons.
I heard lots of fighting and I heard several of my guards die.  I was
thrown in a cell.  By the smell, it had to be Netheragi's cell.  The
smell of a Minotaur's bedchamber is something... unique.'
Justarius says, 'This was when you first learned that the Warlock had
escaped?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Yes.  I was mortified, because I knew he
was powerful in the ways of magic and that he was very evil.  In the
cell I was cut off from the outside world.'
Justarius says, 'Do you know how the prisoners escaped?'
The Warden of Denegorth says, 'Yes.  Somehow some rogues and sneakers
from the Darkfriends guild snuck into my dungeons.  They slew several
guards and stole the main keys.  They then opened all the cells as they
descened into the depths of Denegorth.   They free'd everyone and
whatever guards they didn't kill escaped to the entrance of the
dungeon.'

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is my latest correspondence with my Travel Expert:
Dear Rhyvis
  In my travels I have recently found and explored a large and
interesting portion of our lands. It is an area known as "The
Underworld"  It isn't as wicked as it is named. It's mainly an
underground landscape, complete with a river,  infested with evil.
There are duegar dwarves who have a large settlement down there.
Some large frog-men have a riverside town as well.
  There is a particularly nasty area of ropers and elementals.
I was told there's a city down there but I could not find it. This
region is more or less under-neath Moria which does place it deep
within the ground. 
There's no telling what other evils lie down there.
Sincerely,
A strange traveler

greeting~
    What an exciting time we are in Samserians! A new age is upon us 
and the Oracle is here to tell you it is a grand one indeed. It 
has been reported that after some powerful disturbance in our 
universe there have been multiple cases of humans and creatures 
waking up with a feeling of slight amnesia. How can you tell if 
you've been effected? Try doing things you would normally rely 
on to survive in the great outdoors. (I suggest doing this at 
home as it can be dangerous to test in the outside world) So 
give a dagger a toss or try to levitate. Not working? Fear not 
friend, for once it isn't your slippery mind that has let you 
down again. After some exhausting investigation the Oracle found 
the reason to be at the hands of our creators and handlers, 
those of the immortal realm. What this change means for you is 
that your wisdom now counts for more than stories for the 
grandchildren. After this huge discovery, the Oracle hit the 
streets of Samsera to find local opinions and Mishaelon was kind 
enough to give us some insight on the issue, "Coming from 
someone with no giants, it's had little effect". Mishaelon's 
prophetic words gave us one side of the coin but what about 
those that DID come from giants? Later that night we contacted 
Khog at his chambers for his opinion on the issue. After 
explaining the article to him there was a moment of silence and 
then a somber voice said, "I think they f***ed giants". From 
there we were convinced that the changes made were getting very 
mixed reviews.
    In lighter news, you are now able to specialize after you 
have gained enough worldly experience, creating a finer path and 
opening new opportunities for your chosen profession. This can 
be done by our man Kant in the Samsera library. For a limited 
time he will be giving away the service of relearning your 
skills for free! So if you're interested, please just take a 
walk down to the docks and check him out at the Samsera library. 
    Want to hear what others have been wondering? Head to the 
letters section and if not, go out and hone thy skills 
Samserians. Speak the word that is the bane of evil or embrace 
the darkness, your new world awaits!

~
E
letters~
   Some people have written in to the Oracle with some popular 
questions. So we would like to take a minute to address those 
right now. One reader said, "I keep feeling emaciated and I 
can't figure out why?". Simple answer my friend, eat something! 
Although the Oracle doesn't see this as becoming a fatal problem 
keeping yourself emaciated isn't the healthy way to help you fit 
into those slacks.
    Another question we got a few letters regarding was the time 
in our realm. An anonymous writer asks, "I bought this really 
nice clock on a tiny chain for my girl but she said it's 
useless, so Oracle is this true?". Our response is, "No way!". 
Everything has it's purpose and we find clocks to be a great way 
of keeping the time. Whether you are out practicing your skills 
or our personal favorite, telling your group that they have just 
spent another minute with you!
    Our last reader mailed us saying, "I used to try to sneak 
all the time but now it's like always, On. What's that all 
about?". Well reader it seems the immortals have cut you some 
slack in the repetition department. Instead of forgetting to 
sneak every couple days, you can do it all the time, like using 
a mental switch that can be toggled. Just don't forget that if 
you should experience a temporarily loss of life that you will 
have to do it again.

The Age of the Dead Knight This age is not often named in story books, since
most people with a pure heart want to suppress it and hide it.  But it is as
important if not more important then any other.  It all started with a birth of
a Solamnic knight named Krass.  He developed fast and soon became the best
fighter of all the knights in the camp.  However, Krass did not spend his time
to research magic of a good nature, no.  He made several secret journeys to the
great bronze tower and learned the blackest of all black magic.  According to
the rumours he could merely reach someone with his hands to make a mans heart
stop beating.  As soon as the lords of the Solamnic knights heard about his
deeds, they gathered a group of elite knights to hunt him down before he could
spread his magic further.  They found him and attacked, and when they thought
they had killed him they vent back to Palanthas to celebrate.  What they didn't
know was that Krass was not the only one possessing this magic.  A dark lord
named Skull found his decaying corpse and took it to The keep of the black
heart, which was his stronghold.  Inside the castle they managed to gather
enough power to bring Krass skeleton back to life.  The undead General Krass
then founded the "Knights of the Black rose", these were similar to Solmanic
knights but they spread evil, diseases and harm instead of good.  The guild of
Deathknights was born.  The Age of Guilds How did the rest of the guilds appear
you might ask my son, well as the cities became bigger and bigger, the guild of
thieves and rouges appeared.  Assassins have been a part of the history since
the beginning of times but only in a modest amount.  The shou-lins of course
was founded by monks, some from the great bronze tower who were followers of
Chou-Lung some from the monastery that are here to spread the words of
Dala-i-Lama.  The guild of Shadowdancers have been a guild long hidden in
mysteries, it has been said that they come from a hidden university far away
somewhere in the underdark.  It is believed that they are assassins who
developed a more advanced technique with the use of magic.  Rangers are
dissented of the deep woods, that grow in different parts of the realm.  The
most evil and twisted rangers are scouts who spend their lives in the legendary
Forest of dead, oret d'Morte.  The oldest trace of rangers seen in history is
those who served as Elven scouts, during the war between elves and dwarves.

The Age of Evil Alad-Arach was banned from her lands and as far as the oracle
today know she has never been seen since.  Tiamat and Takhisis made a mutual
agreement to take over the world and control it together.  But since their mind
at that time, were greater then their powers they did not really possess the
force to fulfil their goals.  They needed to capture a land to control and to
gather armies from.  Since their own people were too peaceful they went on a
pillage of their own, gathering treasures from all over the world.  Finally
they founded a colony of supreme evil with dark forces and magic surrounding
them.  It was seated far down in the lands known as "the abyss".  Their powers
in mind and body strengthened over the years and that did not come with all
good.  They were both so egotistical that they could not rule their dark
kingdom together and a battle that according to rumours made the entire realm
quake was fought.  Great storms raged furiously all over the lands for months.
Since Takhisis was the oldest of the two she won and her sister was sent to
Hell with half their riches and treasures.  The Age of the Black King.  The now
most evil of all evil, Xerxes, developed dark magic's and necromantic rituals
and in this way King Xerxes turned totally mad.  As he became wary about the
elves great improvements in the last years he ordered his commanders out on
what he called "The Dark Crusade".  An army of dark denizens led by the
legendary Skathor stormed Palanthas but led heavy casualties, and had to
retreat but.  They managed to capture the elven commander Vikara, and brought
him back to the great tower never to bee seen again.  At the same time a minor
officer and close friend to Xerxes himself, Drelzna, captured the city of
Thalos and released a army of Lamias to prevent the fleeing citizens to ever
returned to their abandoned homes.  These citizens led by a Sultan, adapted
themselves to the nomad desert life.  They started to raise cattle's in the
desert, when finally a little boy named Ishtar, found a river with the freshest
of all water flowing gently in the underground.  Some of the nomads started to
make permanent homes, and so did the Sultans royal family.  The city of New
Thalos was now founded.  The Age of Paladine Since Palanthas had nearly been
destroyed a second time, the new leader of the town a man still wandering the
realm, Amothus decided to establish a new kind of church: "The Solamnic
Knights".  These warriors were all of noble blood who spent a lot of time
researching and praying to the good god Paladin.  They where rough elite
warriors with the knowledge of magic.  This made these knights feared by all
evil.  It is much thanks to this order the city of Palanthas still stands
untouched even if Takhisis and her plebes had made many attempts to destroy the
city but without success.  It is in the age of Paladin a man named Dala-i-lama
was born, far north in a human settlement.  He was a very unique man and he
spent most his days training for battles and meditating.  Later when he grew up
other humans followed his cause and spent time learning his "martial art".  As
Dala-i-lama became older his followers wanted to repay his favour and his prime
student a man named Chou-Lung, vent back north to where he was born and founded
the Monastery and thereby the Shou-lin monk.  They were named that way after
Dala-i-Lamas student Chou-Lung.  Unfortunately Chou was not satiated with being
just "a student".  He wanted to lead, rule and gain power with his art.  So he
did not stay in the monastery.  He left to make a order of his own, the order
of Mortis was born.  This vile order of shou-lins believe in the spread of harm
and suffering instead of the good and peaceful as the monks of Dala-i-lama do.

The Age of the Capital Xi-Erxas now renamed him self Xerxes, and founded the
human town Samsera.  He called it "The capital of the world".  He also built
the largest tower ever created in the realm in pure bronze.  Here he and his
companion Asberdies now retired into deep research of the darkest of magics.  
These books twisted the minds on both of them, and as the years past they
became more and more evil.  They hardly spent any time what so ever to rule
their great kingdom.  Due to this it was taken over by the royal family
referred to as the "Welmars", who have control of the city yet as we speak.  
Xerxes has managed to gather pilgrims and other beings to guard his tower
during the years.  The tower is said to be the best guarded stronghold yet
discovered by man.  The Return of the Elven Lords At this time a great elf,
named Vikara, was born.  When her father died in a battle between Elves and
Orcs, she became the ruler of "old Phatalas" which she renamed Palanthas.  The
elves were now more peaceful and were thereby left alone to rebuild their once
so mighty kingdom, while other races fought each other.  Vikara, who according
to rumours is still alive, improved her city more and more over the years.  
The walls were about twice as tall and twice as thick as the "old Phatalas".  
She developed a new technology, the legendary dragon riders were born and
became a dreaded weapon, feared by all other races.  The Age of the Great
Dragon The greatest of all dragons ever existing in the realm, Alad-Arach, at
that time leader of Draconia.  A small draconian town which lived in peace on a
island in the ocean.  She gave birth to two daughters, and although Alad-Arach
was white almost as silver and of true royal blood, her two younglings where
deep-red and black.  She named them Takhisis and Tiamat.  They both showed
early signs of evil supreme and as the year past they both became almost as big
as their mother, who was wise enough to see what was happening.  She realised
that the evil of her children could not be allowed to spread in the realm.  So
she made a desperate attempt to drive them away, but failed!

&12The History of RavenMud&00. Inscribed by Angmar Darkspyre, in the age of
Trailblazers.  In the beginning of time, when only the immortal beings of Raven
wandered the realm, there was nothing.  So the greatest of all immortals
decided to create a sun, to bring light and heat, the earth for mortals to live
upon and finally water and air.  So the planet which now is referred to as
Khal-Altor could prosper.  They created Elves to rule the land they created
Draconians to conquer the air and great Sharks to hunt the great oceans.  The
second age, The age of Elves.  In the second age of Raven, Elves and Draconians
crossed the great blue ocean, and founded a small colony named "Phatalas".  
That colony grew and prospered for about 2000 years.  The Elves were now far
above all other beings in the research of magic and technology.  Around this
time, Dwarves and Gnomes descended upon the realm.  They founded several minor
cities and the Dwarves in particular exploited the land very hard.  They were
the first to take use of armor and weapons made of iron.  This abuse of mother
nature made the Elven lords truly upset, and the realm of Raven's first real
war was a fact.  The war raged on and off for about 100 years and finally the
elves had to surrender at a great field Samsera, where the town with the same
name lies today.  The Age of Destruction A commander of the Dwarves ordered his
army to keep going for Phatalas, which was plundered and destroyed after so
many years of existence.  For all mages and clerics this was the biggest
disaster that ever happened.  , since many unknown and secret spells were
learned and practiced there.  Most of Phalatas was burned to ruins and remained
such for several years to come.  The human race was at that time limited to
barbarian tribes, fighting each other for crumbs of the Dwarven table.  The Age
of the Great King At the third age, two mysterious men appeared side by side
from the, at that time, unexplored north.  They managed to organise the human
tribes intothe most fearless army the world of Raven had ever seen.  It was led
by one of the men who the Dwarves called Xi-Erxas, meaning "he who cannot die".
The Dwarfish forces were strongly reduced after three hard battles.  So the
Dwarfish lords decided to gather all that was left of their once so mighty and
proud army, and another great battle was fought in the tunnels of Moria.  This
was the first time the Dwarves had ever seen supreme magic in action.  
Earthquakes on the dwarfish side of the field reduced their big army to about
half the size.  The remaining Dwarves were an easy target for Xi-Erxas's
forces.

1.9.1 The Age of the Apocalypse

The final battle between darkness and light was here, it took place over the
entire realm. The forces and protectors of light held the seven seals of the
apocalypse. Seven artifacts that could bring destruction and the end of all
things. As well as the righteous, Darkness had sought out the Seven Trumpets
of the Heavens. As their opposite, they contained immortal power, which if 
used would call the wrath of the Gods down on those who choose to turn from the
light. The world was divided as two, the good and the evil. The first seal
was hidden within the gates of Palanthas, but a minor group of dark rogues
managed to sneak inside the town walls and assassinate the Keeper. The seal
of conquest was recovered and recited by the dark prime thief Drez. A black
angel of Apocalypse descended from heaven to aid the dark forces. With the
aid of the infernal angel Orfiel, the forced of evil won battle after battle
and the righteous had to retreat and try to regroup. Talion resigned his
leadership of the force to take on another quest. With excellent skills in
stealth, he took upon him self to become the soul protector of the seals.
Angmar Darkspyre, a holy warlock filled his position. Talion now made a
legendary escape to a sanctuary of light, the Perceptory. Guarded by elite
paladins and priests he was safe...for the moment.

Now when the seals were well hidden, Angmar ordered his forces of light out
on a crusade for the heavenly trumpets. After a full out war between the two
forces, two trumpets were recovered. The ranger Drizitt blew the
instrument of heavens, and conjured the Angel of Fire, Aratron. With the 
help of Aratron, the evil forces were shattered and had to retreat. However
Aratron was banished back to heaven and it did not take long for the satanic
army to grow strong again. Talion blew the second trumpet, to call for
heavenly help again. The angel of pollution Bethor descent from heaven. It
now seemed that the righteous led by Angmar would win, and thereby avoid
Armageddon. But the evil forces changed their aggressive tactics, and two
of the realms most skilled rogues known as Veschke and Drez, were chosen to
be the guardian of the trumpets. They performed in an almost divine way,
avoiding the righteous army.

The dark forces had managed to break inside the gates of the Perceptory, closing
in on Talion who was hiding in tombs of Grandmaster Slain. The satanic army
found Talion. With the rest of the righteous being out on a hunt for the two
evil rogues, Talion was doomed. But when evil found him a miracle happened 
the ghost of Slain raised from his tomb and rescued Talion from certain death.
Badly wounded he managed to get out from the burning templar church, but the
dark forces recovered two seals from within the church. Khelban didnt
hesitate to use them. The seal of war was released and anarchy started to
reign over heaven and earth. Then he released the seal of famine, and the
nations of the world starved and perished. This was devastating for army of
the light, they were now so weakened that they hardly put up any resistance
against the forced of dark, and seal after seal was captured. When the 
fourth seal was released, everyone knew what awaited.

 It was the seal of Death, the Hermits prophecy from the fourth age had become
a reality. The four horsemen stormed through the gates of Hell unleashing everything
that was locked behind them. The apocalypse was a fact. The dark army who now 
thought they were victorious, and would be spared from the wrath, were proven wrong. No
one was spared when the sixth seal was activated. The earth opened up,
pouring seas of fire and lava onto the land, it was a earthquake of never
before seen proportions devastated everything. Whole continents were 
swallowed by the earth, people running around trying to escape the inevitable. Both
good and evil suffered the same fate. All that was left was a cold void.

Now it was up to the evil immortals to activate the last seal, the seventh.
And so they did. The world collapsed into nothing. Only the honourable prime
immortals survived. They granted some of the most powerful mortal beings
souls immortality. And from this nothing, they began to create a new world.
A world that they would call Raven II.

*editor's note*
  History is a subjective thing and when told it must always be understood
that the teller will always color the events with their own views or objectives.
Angmar has recounted a vast history of ages when much knowledge was lost. He has
done an admirable job as a historian but it is after all..his tale..not to be taken
as the absolute truth of all that has ever happened on this chaotic world.

1.8.0 The Age of Enlightenment
 

The world lived on peacefully, new towns by all sorts of races were founded.
New continents were discovered and explored. A new elven village was also
founded. Fairhaven City, a great city were new skills in magic and in the 
art of war were taught. Man reached for answers in everything, from how our
universe worked to how to improve leatherworks. Scientists from all over the
world made revolutionary discoveries and people in general, improved their life
and wealth to a new standard. For every year that went by the righteous grew
stronger, nothing seemed to slow down their progress. Servants of evil were
purged daily, until one day when a explorer named Jamar stumbled upon a 
large iron gate, to what seemed to be a new realm. He returned home and informed
the townsmen of what he had discovered. He called it "the lands of Chaos". 
He did not know how right he was about this god forgotten place. Jamar and his
brave group travelled for months to the new found land, and entered through
the huge gates and the werent heard from for a long time. No one knew what
happened to them, until several months later when Jamar returned alone
, badly wounded and informed King Welmar of the horror that they had met.
They did not realise that they had left the gates open when they fled, allowing
the forces and creatures of Chaos to enter the righteous lands.

1.8.2 The Age of Chaos

Welmar ordered his mighty armies, led by the cleric Mithros, to
execute a well planned attack against the discovered Chaotic lands. They
marched for months before they reached the gates. The minions of Chaos put
up a good battle, but were defeated in the end. When forcing the battle 
deeper inside, they made a horrific discovery. They found the seven seals of
apocalypse all gathered in one place. It was these seals that kept Takhisis
and Tiamat locked away.

Since the land of Chaos was neutral, they could not use them to bring down
Armageddon over the world, they had merely acted as evil's guardians of the seals. 
King Welmar knew that bringing the seals back to Samsera, would target the town for all evil. So he decided to create an elite group of holy crusaders, that he formed from the best and
most skilful warriors. A shou-lin monk from the order of Dala-i-lama by the
name of Talion, was given the responsibility of guarding the keys. He did so
by moving then around from one place to another, so that evil could not 
track their location at any time. However, the Dark side was not slow to form an
elite group of warriors with the sole mission of finding Talions squad and
recover the seven seals. They also had something the righteous wanted, the
dark side had previously acquired the seven Trumpets of heaven, the 
righteous opposite of the Seals. This elite group was led by a vicious dark magician,
Khelban. Soon the two forces met, leading to a final quest between good and evil.
and the final chapter of Raven's history.

1.7.2 The Battle of Midgaard
 
Welmar had managed to regroup and called on Midgaards surrounding villages 
for help. With the aid of the gnome clerics and the knights of Krynn, he was 
once again ready to face to armies of Hell. Kochbiel did not stop to rest after
plundring the elven villiges. Instead he went straight for Midgaard. The
black army was far superior to the righteous troops, and Kochbiel was
certain of victory. He considered Midgaard, and thereby the world as his. 
But the good gods in the realm was watching and felt they had to intervene.
Welmar and the good gods made a pact, but it was to a great cost. The
righteous gods had to  disband the Seven seals of Apocalypse and spread them
in various parts of the realm. To the cost of if they were ever to be used,
it would for sure bring an end to the world. With the aid of the righteous
gods,  Kochbiels army was defeated. When the news of their defeat reached
Tiamat he became furious, and banished Kochbiel to an unbreakable prison in
hell. Time vent by and Samsera, Midgaard and the villages were recovering.
Peace was settling in the lands, and hells army was locked behind their own
gates. The keys were guarded by the most powerful of Palanthian priests, the
Priests of Hell. They were trained for their duty from the day they was 
born, and had great knowledge in magic and in the arts of war. A retired hero from
the battles of Samsera, Ruby, once again opened Diamond's legendary
weapon-shop, and things were slowly returning to how they once were.

1.7.1 The Dark Ages

- Constant battles between good and evil were fought all over the realm, new
orders and clans flourished and died. In these times the righteous citizens
of Palanthas along with the Solamnic orders were in full out war with mad King 
Xerxes, whom they had sworn to defeat. In the meantime the Queen of darkness
hid safely protected behind nine unbreakable gates. The battles between
Palanthas and Xerxes were near-fatal for both sides and they both suffered heavy
casualties. The war ended with a "tie". The city of Palanthas was so 
weakened from the wars, that even small roving bands of Orcs and Ogres  were able 
to raid with impunity. If it wasnt for the aid of King Welmar and the citizens of
Samsera, Palanthas would once again have been destroyed. During this time
also referred as "the infernal times" Tiamat unlocked the nine gates of 
Hell and unleashed a great army of Abishai demons and the Assassins from hell. 
The army was led by a feared demon known as Kochbiel. Cities and villages were
plundered one by one, and the elves was so crippled they could only stand
and watch. For a long time many believed that this was harmageddon. The end
of the world. After six months Kochbiel and his army reached the gates of
Samsera, were elves and humans gathered their last forces to what everyone
believed would be the final battle. Before ordering his troops to attack
Kochbiel, standing in the front of his fearless army, shouted to King 
Welmar:

"I have crossed the Plains of Despair, I am the leader of the black army.
Beneath my feet lies blackened bones of countless slayed. Prepare to meet
thine maker King Welmar!"

... And the infernal army charged the walls of protecting Samsera, which were
breached very quick, and the endless army worked their way into the
town square. Welmars army was forced to retreat west, all the way to 
Midgaard to regroup and draft more men. Samsera was plundered to the last crumb of
bread. The legendary shopkeeper Diamond, who had forever provided Samsera
with his services, was captured. Old and weak, unable to break free, he was
brought before Kochbiel. The general brutally executed the shopkeeper for
everyone to behold, as a reminder of what awaits he who crosses his path.
Some say, according to the legend, that his soul never could find its peace.
And that his ghost still haunts the realm.

6.1 The sixth age, The Age of the Black King.
 
After long years of studying the darkest of spells and absorbing himself in the
most debased rituls of necromancy, King Xerxes became possesed by the evil he studied
and gradually became a madman. He began to hate and fear any whose magical prowess
threatened to equal or surpass his own. He learned that the elves were becoming masters
of the arcane arts, so he ordered his commanders to gather and sent them forth
on what he called the Dark Crusade. A vast army of his dark creatures issued forth
led by the legendary Skathor. They stormed Palanthas but suffered heavy casualties, and
had to retreat but they managed to capture the elven commander Vikara, and
brought him back to the great tower, never to be seen again. At the same
time a minor officer and close friend to Xerxes himself, Drelzna captured
the city of Thalos and released a army of Lamias to prevent the fleeing
citizens from ever returning to their homes. These citizens led by a Sultan,
adapted themselves to the nomad desert life, and started to raise cattle
in the desert, when finally a little boy named Ishtar, found a river with the
freshest of all water flowing gently in the underground. Some of the nomads
started to make permanent homes, and so did the Sultans royal family. Thus it was
that the city of New Thalos caame to be founded.
 
6.2 The age of Paladin
 
- Since Palanthas had been close to being nearly destroyed for a second time, the new
leader of the city, Amothus, a well respected leader who had narrowly survived previous battles,
decided to establish a militant order. This order of 'Solamnic Knights' as they came to be known
were all valiant and moral men who dedicated themselves to preserving the balance of good.
They were a elite group, rough as any warrior but with the knowledge of magics. This
made these knights feared by all things evil. It is much thanks to this order that
city of Palanthas still stands untouched despite several attempts by Takhisis and his
grotesque armies to destroy it. The Solamnic Knights suffered much but prevailed nonetheless.
It was in this age that a man named Dala-i-lama where born far north in a human
settlement. This man was a very unique in his attempts to combine spirituality and combat
training. Soon many students came to visit and to learn his "martial arts". As Dala-i-lama
grew older his students became masters intheir own right and one of these, Chou-Lung
eventually left and founded a Monastery in the mountains to further these disciplines.
The followers of Dala-i-lama and Chou-Lung became known as Shou-lins. Chou, however,
eventually became bent from the path of enlightenment and begin to plot how to use
these powers for gain. It is suspected that his mind was perhaps corrupted from afar by
Takhisis..but soon he founded a seperate order called Mortis whose followers worshipped
only self indulgence and material gain at the expense of those weaker than themselves

            The History Of Raven
Told to me, by Angmar Darkspyre, in the age of Trailblazers

- In the beginning of times when only the immortal beings of Raven
wandered the realm, there was nothing. So the greatest of all immortals
decided to create a sun, to bring light and heat. The earth for mortals
to live upon and finally water and air, so the planet witch now is referred
as Khal-Altor could prosper.
 
1:2.1 The second age, The age of Elves.
 
 - In the second age of Raven, Elves and Draconians crossed the great blue
ocean, and founded a small colony named "Phatalas" that colony growth and
prospered for about 2000 years. The elves was now far above all other beings
in the research of magics and technology. Around this time, dwarves and
gnomes were descent upon the realm. They founded several minor cities and
the dwarves in particular exploited the land very hard, and they were the
first to take use of armour and weapons made of iron. This abuse of mother
nature made the Elven lords truly upset, and the realm of Raven's first
real war was a fact. The war raged on and off for about 100 years and 
finally the elves had to surrender at a great field, where the town of Samsera
lies today.
 
 1:2.2 The Age of Destruction
 
A commander of the dwarves ordered his army to keep going for the city of Phatalas,
which was plundered and destroyed after so many years. For all mages and clerics
this is the biggest disaster that have ever happened since many now unknown
spells were learned and used there. Most of Phalatas was burned to ruins for
several years to come. The human race was at that time limited to barbarian
tribes fighting each other for crumbs off the dwarven table.

1:3.1 The third age, The age of the Great King
 
 - At the start of the third age, two mysterious men appeared side by side
from the, at that time, unexplored north. They manage to organize the human
tribes into the most fearless army, the world of Raven had ever seen. It was
led by one of the men, who the dwarves called Xi-Erxas meaning "he who cannot die".
The dwarven forces were strongly reduced after only three hard battles. The
dwarves gathered all that was left of their once mighty army and attacked again.
This last great battle was fought in the tunnels of Moria. This was the first
time the dwarves had ever seen such magic and earthquake spells on the dwarven
side of the field, reduced their once big army to about half the size.
The remaining dwarves were an easy target for Xi-Erxas forces.
 
1:3.2 The age of the Capital
 
 Xi-Erxas now renamed him self Xerxes, and founded the human town Samsera,
calling it "The capital of the world". He also built the largest tower ever
created in the realm. In pure bronze where he and his companion Asberdies
now retired into deep research in the darkness and most evil of magics. 
These books twisted the minds of both of them and as the years passed they became
more and more evil, and hardly spent and time what so ever, to rule their
great kingdom, witch was taken over by the royal family referred to as the
"Welmars" who have control of the city yet while we speak. Xerxes had
managed to gather pilgrims and other beings to guard his tower during the years,
and the tower is said to be the best guarded stronghold yet discovered by man.

a battle between elves and orcs, he was now the ruler of "old Phatalas" which 
he renamed Palanthas, the elves were now allot more peaceful and were thereby
left alone to rebuild their once so mighty kingdom while other races fought each
other. Vikara who according to rumours is still alive, improved his city 
more and more over the years, so the walls were about twice as tall and twice as
thick as the "old Phatalas" he researched allot of new technology, the
legendary dragon riders were born in this time and was a dreaded weapon,
feared by all other races. The old Hermit are believed to have spoken of a
vision regarding the apocalypse at this time.. He claimed that great evil
sealed within several great doors would be unleashed and that four furious
riders would come storming through the gates one by one, spreading death,
famine, war and pestilence in their trail. Everyone believed that this
prophecy regarded the great tower of Xerxes so the elves decided the tower
had to be destroyed... This would later prove to be fatal.
 
5.1 The fifth age, The age of the Great Dragon
 
- The greatest of all dragons ever existing in the realm, Alad-Arach at that
time leader of Draconia a small, draconian town which lived in peace on a
island in the ocean, gave birth and although Alad-Arach was white almost in
silver and of true royal blood, her two younglings where deep-red and the
other was black. He named them Takhisis and Tiamat, they both showed early
signs of evil supreme and as the year past they both became almost as big as
their mother, who was wise enough to see what was happening, that the evil
of her children could not be allowed to spread in the realm. So she made a
desperate attempt to drive them away, but failed! and instead she was driven
off and as far as scientists today know she have never been seen. Tiamat and
Takhisis made a mutual agreement to take over the known world and control it
together, but since their mind at that time, were greater then their powers
they did not really possess the force to fulfil their goal, they needed to
capture land to control and to gather armies from. Since their own people
were way to peaceful they went on a pillage on their own gathering treasures
from all over the world. Finally the founded a colony of supreme evil with
dark forces and magic surrounding them, far down in the lands known as  "the
abyss" their powers in mind and body strengthend over the years and that did
not come with all good. They were both so egoistical they could not rule
their dark kingdom together and a battle that according to rumours, made the
entire realm quake, and started great storms that raged furious all over the
lands. Since Takhisis was the oldest of the two she won, and her sister was
descent to hell with half their riches and treasures.

1.6.3 The age of the Dead Knight
 
Stories of this age are often not written down in story books, since most people with a pure
] heart prefer to suppress it. But for all its horror and tragedy it is a tale worth learning perhaps
] more important then any other. It all started with a Solamnic knight named Krass
] who was born just outside Paladine. He grew fast and soon became the best fighter of all the
] Solamnic Knights. However Krass had a terrible secret...in that his heart was from the day
] he was born, black as night. Thus at the times he was supposed to be learning white magic
] he would steal away to dark corners and study all he could of the dark forces. Eventually he
he would steal away to dark corners and study all he could of the dark forces. Eventually he
ran off and it was rumored he found his way to the great tower on the desert and became a disciple
] His powers became vast under the tutelge of the Mad King and it was said he could stop a
] man's heart with a touch. Horrified by this renegade, the Solamnic Order sought him out to
destoy him and restore the good name of the Order. They caught up with him one day and blasted
with magic and hewed him with swords. Believing Krass to be dead the Order rode off.
What the Order did not know was that hidden nearby was a sinister dark fortress whose guardians
had sensed the magical forces nearby. A party of sable-clad soldiers rode forth and brought
the still living body of Krass before their Lord. When Krass awaoke he found himself facing
one of Takhisis's most feared creations..Lord Skull the Death Knight. In a sepulchral voice
voice Skull told Krass that Skull would make him a commander of a knightly order dedicated
to wiping out the Solamnic Knights. The new order would be known as the Knights of the Black Rose
Several years later Krass had the idea of forming a 'guild' in several large cities in order
to recruit new members and to spread subversion and evil. Thus the Death Knight Guild was born.
 
1.6.4 The Age of Guilds
 
During these years other guilds had also sprung up as a means to enhance commerce and to
spread as well as protect the knowledge of certain classes of people. The clerics guild
did much to spread the knowledge of the healing arts across the lands. The rangers guild
did much to protect the wildlands from ruthless exploitation by merchants. The mage guild
kept its knowledge shrouded in secrecy but still offered ceratin arcane services to the public.
Even the various rogues guilds brought a certain sense of order and stability to the cities
in which they operated. Although politics and greed did cause conflicts within and between
some guilds (for example the Shadowdancer revolt) by and large with the exception of the
Death Knight's guild, the guild system did much to bring parts of the world together.

An Ode to the Defenders.

The cry of the Nazgul echoed through peaceful Samsera,
Their Riders marched with blackened armor,
terrorizing many and ruining everything in their stride
towards the City of Grandeur, of Glamour.
Assassins who would name themselves Jikk walked the
side streets maiming those who they saw fit for their
dark thrysts.

The Mayor called for his guards.
The Master of Arms rallied his troops, calling many
and any who would fight for the Cause.
Messengers were sent to the Elven Lords, the
Dwarven Kings, and even the fabled Halfings of old.
Alas, none would reach their destination.
Black fire surrounded the land, and all who crossed
either were made to sombering ashes,
or were slain by the numerous hordes of damnation.

Beyond the fiery darkness a winged behemoth rose,
and with him an army of Deep Moria's great warriors. 
His voice thundered, reaching to the very heights of
Olympus itself. "I am Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs."
And with a crack of thunder, the siege had begun.

Many of those who tooks arms were slain.
Conscripts from nearby Midgaard, Guardsmen of
Greater Samsera, even the heroic Master of Arms fell
before the Invasion. But lo! Hope was not lost.
A crowd had gathered amidst the onslaught of
the Balrogs. Small were they compared to the army that
had beseiged them, but they held their ground fighting
for their lives, for a Cause greater than their own,
for the greatness that was Samsera.

Securing the city, a minotaur walked the streets.
By his leave, a group of valiant adventurers followed,
breaking the Invaders from the eastern side of the front.
But alas! More came from the west and the north.
And Assassins with knives wrought from Hell itself
lingered in hidden alleys waiting to strike on those
unsuspecting.

Rangers and Warriors were summoned to arms,
Knights were called upon by their liege-lords,
Clerics and Casters were roused from their guilds,
then suddenly, the small crowd which once ventured on its
own grew into an army whose name shall live on till the end
of the City it was spawned from - the Defenders of Samsera.

No longer were young Balrogs a threat,
No longer did daggers bring fear,
No longer did the Riders ride,
for they were dead. All save for the Lord of the
Balrogs that leered from the northern gates of
the City. He spoke dark threats, fumed over
idle insults and almost crossed the Gates that 
partially held him at bay.

The Defenders rammed at the threat full force,
but neither strength nor skill managed to beset
the terror. Many days passed, many nights drew,
but the battle would not end. Bloodshed, chaos,
the coming of more Balrogs were beyond reckoning.
Until after the 30th day, and countless deaths later, 
the final blow was struck.

He waned, glared and fell before those who struggled. 
His wail reached the High Tower of the Mad King, 
it roused the Hydra from its long sleep,
even those who lived by the boundaries of Chaos managed
to hear bits of the unearthly sound.
Alas, it was in vain. 

A dark cloud came about and swept his horrific body from the
lands of great Raven.

Gothmog, Lord of the Balrogs, was Lord no longer.

The fires were extinguished, the darkness lifted, and
Samsera was born anew. Much sorrow to those who
perished, and much gratitude for their valor. For yonder
years they will be remembered, and stories such as this
shall be told for many generations to come.

Glory to Samsera!
Glory to its Defenders!

Death of the Avenger.

Mars Avenger of the bloodline of Gimli,
bastard of the noble House Debonair,
loyal servant of the the Mandala.

The drunk dwarf- who has devoted his life 
to chasing elven women, rampaging gnomish 
settlements, and emptying beer kegs- 
no longer exists as a part of the living realms 
we know as Raven.

Chaos within and purity without
brought about the demise of the
fabled gnome slayer as he fought
valiantly against the raging tides
of Chaos during the Great Invasion.

Volunteering to head the assault against
Evil's stronghold, he and many others
braved the onslaught as grim hordes flanked
the attacking party on all sides, forcing
numerous casualties. The killing was swift,
the death cries voiceless as bodies piled against
each other in the wake of deadly stabs and
spells of paralysis. A stone tablet marked by
a great sword which he named after himself
lies on the open field unblemished, but perhaps
forgotten. 

Mars Avenger, unavenged.

Iridescent ward scales ~
   This ward is crafted out of dragon scales and mithril ore.  It was designed
and forged by the armor known as Ruby.  The style and quality of the ward makes
it an invaluable object.  Judging from the different types of dragon scales on
the ward, there is a good chance the item will protect those that would use it
from the affects of dragon breath.
