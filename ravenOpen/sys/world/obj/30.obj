This is a reminder of some of our rules here at Raven.  This a brief
restatement of previous posts by the Raven Staff.

It is against the rules to use triggers to make you assist, attack, or cast
spells while you are AFK.   It is perfectly legal to have triggers do that
while you are at the keyboard.  This is called Roboting.

If you find yourself in an unlinked area leave immediately.  You'll know
it's closed because you won't be able to walk N,S,E,W,D,U

All reimburse requests must be made via mudmail to Maestro.
Profanity.  To Restate Policy here, there is to be no profanity over public
channels. This encompasses OOC, Roleplay, Query, Quest, Guild, and Using
your Title.  This makes it acceptable using say, emotes, group tells, and
tells.  Acronyms like wtf and words like s**t do count as profanity.

Brew/Scribe.  Do not brew/scribe pots/scrolls for your alt to use.  This is
just as offensive as multi-linking.

Char-jumping.  This is when you, for example, rent your ranger, login your
thief to pick a couple doors, then rent your thief and log back in as your
ranger and walk through those doors.  This is just as offensive as
multi-linking.  An acceptable scenario would be that you rent your ranger,
login your thief and play your thief for a while.

Lieing to imms or going behind an imms back.   This is just real bad.

The things stated here just recap the origional postings of rules on the
policy board and in help files.  The staff here at RavenMUD try to present 
a fun game for everyone and we do need some rules for this game to remain
fun and fair for all.  So we ask each and every person that plays here to 
please follow our rules and policies.  We also ask everyone to have fun 
playing our game.

Your Raven Staff.
