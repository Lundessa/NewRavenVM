To add a new social create it and stuff it in either the a_m or
n_z subdirectory. See if you can figure out which one. Next, edit
the mksocials script and place your New And Wonderful social into
the %socials_list associative array by listing the socials full
name followed by the minimum position needed to execute it. Once
this is done, exit mksocials and execute it with a list of all of
the possible social files that it should use. Viola! A new socials
and interp_socials.c file will be created.

Example:

1) create raise.soc in n_z with the following:

raise 1 0
You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
$n raises an eyebrow questioningly.
You raise an eyebrow questioningly.
$n raises an eyebrow questioningly.
$n raises an eyebrow questioningly.
Eh, who?
You wiggle your eyebrows.
$n wiggles $s eyesbrows.

2) add    "raise", $POS_RESTING   to the array.

3) Generate the new files:   mksocials a_m/* n_z/*
