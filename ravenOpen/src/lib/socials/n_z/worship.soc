worship 0 5
You find yourself head-down in the dirt, worshipping.
$n starts worshipping nothing at all.
You fall to your knees and worship $M deeply.
$n falls to $s knees, worshipping $N with uncanny dedication.
$n kneels before you in solemn worship.
Uh.. who?  They're not here, pal.
You seem sure to have found a true deity.....
$n falls to $s knees and humbly worships $mself.
