You beg the gods for mercy.  (No way you're gonna get it! :-))
The gods fall down laughing at $n's request for mercy.
You desperately try to squeeze a few coins from $M.
$n begs you for money.  You gratiously let $m peep at your fortune.
$n begs $N for a dime or two -- or twenty!
Your money-lender seems to be out for the moment.
How? - begging yourself for money doesn't help.
