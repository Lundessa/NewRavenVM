# CLASS    -
#    This target is used in conjunction with the LIBRARY target. When
#    a developer wishes to build and maintain object file in an ar
#    library, the LIBRARY is defined and the source file that comprise
#    the library are listed here.
# CLASS       =

# LIBRARY  -
#    This target allows the developer to build lib.a files with the
#    Unix ar command. The target that is used to do this is a GNU
#    make specific target. The use of this target is optional and
#    unneeded if the developer will not be creating a lib.a file.
# LIBRARY     =

# BINARIES -
#    This target should define the name(s) of any executables that
#    need to be built in the current directory. By default, this
#    target expects to be a list of C files that contain a main.

# INSTALL_BINS -
# INSTALL_LIBS -
#    These targets are only used when 'make install' is invoked. The
#    installation targets will copy the files listed in these two macros
#    to the configuration areas defined by the configure process. These
#    targets will rarely be invoked by the average user but should ALWAYS
#    be defined so that once the software is checked in and configured
#    configuration manager can simply do a 'make install' to install the
#    new library/header/binary files. Add utility files in this location
#    that don't require regular recompilation.

# INSTALL_LIBS=

# INSTALL_SDIR -
# INSTALL_HDRS -
#    These targets allow the user to customize how and where header files
#    are installed. By default, header files will end up in the subdirectory
#    defined by the INC_DIR_I variable, but some installations need to add
#    another level within the default include directory. This allows the
#    user to create directory  structures like $INC_DIR_I/include/somedir
#    to install the class header files. Programs needing access to the class
#    could then include <somedir/someclass.H> to reference the class.

# CFLAGS -
#    This macro can be used to define special compiler switches that need
#    to be set when compiling the code listed above. For example, after the
#    is fully debugged the -g switch may be changed to -O for optimization.
# CFLAGS      = $(SHLIB_CFLAGS)

# CPPFLAGS -
#    This macro should contain any special define switches needed to build
#    special version of the code.
# CPPFLAGS    =

# LIBDEPEND -
#    This macro should contain any additional libraries needed to
#    build the executables listed in the BINARIES line from above. These
#    libraries will be used for dependency checks as well as linking. The
#    'lm' library is the math C library, which must be linked at compile
#    time (so don't remove it during cleanings!).

# INCLUDE_DIRS -
# LIBRARY_DIRS -
#    These two macros can be used to define additional subdirectories for
#    make to look in for various libraries and include files.

#    LIB Examples: -L../.. -L$(MY_TOP) -L/home/users/john/mystuff

#    This target has been left in here so that users can customize it to suite
#    their needs. The definitions that are pulled in from the Makedefs should
#    be able to construct 90 percent of all source code into usable libraries
#    and binaries.
